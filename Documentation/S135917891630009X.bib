abstract = {Psychopathy is a personality disorder associated with the manipulation of others and with impulsive, irresponsible, and antisocial behavior. This systematic review of literature focuses on the language of psychopathy. PsycInfo (CSA), Medline, Science Direct, ProQuest, PubMed, and other databases have been searched through key terms such as language, psychopathy, and neuropsychological aspects. So, research suggests that individuals diagnosed with psychopathy recognize the internal structure of the words and their principles, and the processes that regulate their morphological configuration. In other words, the phonetic competence allows individuals with psychopathy to identify and create new words and observe the respective combinatorial rules that help recognize sounds outside system, select appropriate settings for different realizations of each phoneme, and choose morphemes for words that have never been heard.}
