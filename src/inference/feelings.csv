"Not just who they are going forward, but in some cases who they were. The image of them you had in your head - the trust and belief that they would be there, loving you, supportive, like they said they would be. Like they had been. 

Stonewalling. Cold. With every next step in the fucking paperwork, more stitches that had sewn the two of you together are painfully ripped out.

I hate this whole process. I am a half destroyed human. I am so tired of crying."|hopelessness loneliness sadness worthlessness|loneliness hopelessness sadness emptiness anger worthlessness

I was going through a really rough time as far as my mental health goes. My therapist wasn't the right one for me, so I quit going and was really not feeling so great and was in a pretty dark place. My roommate and I decided to get a cat and ever since my mood has definitely improved. The first few months he hid and was super anxious and I was like same dude. Then after a while he decided he could trust us and have been amazing. He sleeps in my bed every night and loves to talk to me. It's really nice having him there when my roommate isn't home. His presence makes me feel a little less alone. I still struggle with it, but he's made it a little easier cause I have this cute little guy that's always happy to see me. Just thought I'd share this for anyone who is thinking about getting an ESA or just wanted something nice to read.||loneliness
I got perscribed sleeping tablets, some anti depressants and a couple other things some time ago, my dad recently found out now won’t stop trying to make me not take them and saying it isn’t natural.

"My wife informed me she wanted a divorce, and she requested we use a “collaborative divorce” group.  She eventually pulled out when she realized that process wouldn’t get her the money she wanted and then lawyered up.

However, as part of that process we negotiated temporary separation agreement that had her spending 10 more hours a week with the kids, but giving me 4 of 7 overnights.

Now it’s turned nasty. However - by the rules of our state I am now the primary caregiver because I have the majority of overnights. Her lawyer is frantically trying to change the agreement but my lawyer is making me hold firm.  Her request for temporary spousal support is floundering because of our temporary parenting time agreement.

It was not intentional - we were just working around our schedules.  However it accidentally  ended up working in my favor.  It may not for you though - so get a lawyer."|anger hopelessness sadness|anger sadness hopelessness

A few years ago I met someone on a game, he was my best friend since then and always helped me through everything, but recently I’ve been very busy and I have barely been able to talk to him for a week and I was rude to him and shrugged him off and I feel horrible about it but after a while he sent me a ton of texts in Spanish (we aren’t from the same country) saying that I should wait to attempt to translate them and that he wouldn’t be home alone for long I begged him to stay and I apologized for all the rude things I said and wanted to spend the day playing with him, but he then blocked me completely on everything and I translated the message and it was all about him seeing me in the afterlife and wanting to commit due to some personal problems. He thanked me for so much and said sorry for bringing to little.

I almost did it yesterday. I skipped school and went into the woods with some alcohol and a rope and I planned to end my life. I tied the noose and I jumped from a tree. Miraculously my neck didn’t break and and a homeless man came out of nowhere and cut me down. In that second that I was hanging from the tree all I could think about was how much of a mistake it was. I spent the rest of that day talking with the homeless man and learning about his experiences and I realized that life has its ups and downs but that’s what life is, you gotta live through the pain because it’s all experiences, not good or bad experiences, just experiences.

"I’m not sure when it happened but for some reason I have lost all ability to “relax” in a “normal” way. I can’t not be doing something in terms of work whether it’s my actual job (BA & programmer) or cleaning or organizing or laundry or financial planning...etc. If I try to sit and watch TV or play a game or just spend time with my kids, I’m riddled with anxiety and guilt and my mind is racing and I’m trying to stop it from actually thinking because that is damned dangerous especially when it gets into “Hey! Remember 1996? No? Are you sure? Here’s 800 traumatic memories in case you’re not sure.”

Not to mention the whole time she was with the most recent, all her past traumas from her childhood, he told her wasn’t viable reasons to claim she had ptsd. In his opinion unless you’re a veteran you don’t know what ptsd is. He constantly reminded her that she was nothing and would be nothing. Yet he was the one who couldn’t pay bills and needed to utilize every single outlet he could, simply because he didn’t want to work. He would leave her home, with three children, and take the car so she couldn’t leave. He was a literal monster.

Although, I know there are people in my life who welcomed me to speaking to them, I find myself to not really trust them anymore. Maybe it’s because they’re not reliable to me anymore since they’re so busy caring about themselves.

I say that because despite its crushing feeling at the best of times, It makes me aware of what others may be suffering through.

Very few remember we exist other than when they see us out or at the things we may or may not attend.

We love more, hug tighter, cherish a persons attention and time; cause we know what its like to feel abandoned, alone and miserable in silence.

I am now at a point in the relationship where he constantly mocks and manipulates me. For example, I'll ask him if he can cuddle with me more often and he'll start saying ""oh my gosh I'm such a terrible boyfriend for not cuddling with you as often as you like.

It's m-fing discipline. That's what I need this year. Discipline to stop thinking about my ex husband, who walked out to be with another woman. Discipline to find a good job, and to kick ass at that job and make myself indispensable. Discipline to lose 15 lbs, eat better food, and exercise. Discipline to stick to a strict budget and get my finances in good order. Discipline to stop feeling sorry for myself and being weepy about the life I thought I was going to have, but instead to find a new vision of what I want in life, and to make plans and put in the work to get there. No one is going to come save me, or fix me- this is all on me and I need to strap my boots on and hit the ground running. It's going to take discipline. Please root for me, friends.

My bf (soon to be ex) and I shared a few mutual friends and he created a wedge between me and all of them by talking nastily about me to them. In addition, he’s also isolated me from all my other friends too.

Anyway, when I found out what he was up to and said I’m done with the relationship, he apologised profusely and said he’d never let me down again. Fast forward 2 months, he was doing it again and threatened to commit suicide if I left him.

- I got ostracized from a friend group I held dear to my heart a year prior to friend’s tragic death, leaving me with little to no support system. It really made me wonder about the value of true friendship.

"Tw ED

Not only did he royally screw up major details about my visits (like he phoned it in and wasn't even listening!) But all my other therapists would write things like

Appearance: well groomed, appropriately dressed.

This new therapist did that for a couple visits. I struggle with eating disorders (fear of food, days without eating) and he'd write 

Appearance: overweight. 


That's it. Overweight. I went to my normal doctor who is telling me I can't afford to lose weight due to my eating disorders. But my therapist stopped commenting on Appearance that indicates where my mental health is at, and simply writes ""overweight"". Mind you, I am not overweight.  My shirt size is medium, and I have broad shoulders but I'm in no way obese. 

For the first time in a long time my body isn't skeleton like and bruised from lack of weight. I have pica due to deficiencies in iron from my eating disorders and snack on chalk. I know it's weird but it's something I do.

Hey guys, so I’ve been in a hole the last few months, you can see my Reddit history 💀🤡. And I noticed I’ve been forgetting to take some things like my lexapro at night.

I feel like other people have had this issue, and if so, was there something yall did to help remember?

Last year on Mother’s Day my husband woke up and went for his 40+ mile bike ride and then came home around 11am and as an after thought he ran to the store and bought flowers for the girls to bring me. My feelings were hurt and I cried. He called me mentally unstable and said I should seek psychiatric help… for crying. For being sad that he didn’t care enough to plan or make the day special. Lmao cause it’s funny now in hindsight. So this year I have NO expectations whatsoever. He has the kids today and will drop them off at 9am tomorrow. I will take them to brunch and bowling!

"TW: R4PE, D0MEST1C VI0LENC3

Hello, I'm writing the script for a future comic that talks about abusive relationships, overcoming these relationships and trusting someone again and I needed to hear reports from people who have been through these relationships.

I didn't want to make this story just based on what I know about the topic and I wanted to hear from other people about what it's like to go through one to know how to properly represent my characters.

They are two main characters who went through abusive love relationships in different ways. One suffered d0mest1c vi0lenc3 and one was r4ped, and what I wanted to hear is how you feel after suffering something like that or while suffering it.

DISCLAIMER: You don't have to tell me the story of what happened if you're not comfortable, I just wanted to know what kind of thoughts you got after the event, how you felt, or how you got over it."||sadness

Most of us go through that period of time and life where we find everything useless and not worth it. You don't want to live anymore, you feel worthless, you don't know what would make you happy, you feel like you're a burden. We all have experienced this. What made me get past that stage was finding something worth living for. When humans didn't care about me, i got a pet. A baby bird. She was everything to me and me to her. She depended on me for her survival, she always wanted her cuddles and she hated everyone else. That made me find something worth living. I was the reason to her survival and now, I have a reason to live. Find a pet for yourself, or find a hobby, get something that would make you happy. Be it legos or the new comedy genre books and movies you prefer, you now have a reason to live. It will be hard to get to that stage but once you start jogging towards it, you would never get back.

""END it so you won't feel any pain""

My boyfriend is my strongest support and tries his best to help but it's so hard for me and I don't always want to go to him when I need reassurance because he's not my therapist and I don't want him to feel like he always has to fix things or I don't want to burden him or have him take on my stress (he's never called me a burden I just feel guilty sometimes for telling him) and I want to be strong on my own but right now it's so hard.

I’m 26/F and I’ve never dated anyone. I guess because I’ve always been busy. First with school, then with work. And now things aren’t working out anymore and it makes me realize just how lonely I am. I never had fun. Barely had friends. It seems like nothing was worth it. I just want someone to hold me while I cry to them, someone to talk to about the most mundane things, someome to love and be loved by. Reality is so different because I know it might never happen.|hopelessness loneliness sadness|loneliness hopelessness sadness emptiness worthlessness

"I was recently diagnosed with PTSD stemming from a sexual assault that occurred last year. I have had nightmares, flashbacks, being overly cautious, etc. 

I still don't feel like my case is nearly as bad as others, as my sexual assault only lasted about 15 seconds, and was from an intimate partner. I am also a man, and it was done to me by a woman. It was very painful and I still can feel the pain vividly in my mind. It was a horrible experience.

I feel like my body wasn't only raped, but so was my mind. It's a hellish existence I'm living. But I don't feel like my case is nearly as bad as some others I've heard. I never thought I would be sexually assaulted because I was never taught that this can happen to men, and I'm very ashamed for feeling the way I do.

I’m (f38) so tired of life… and it is so weird… I’m close to my family, I have people that care about me so much that my plan is to hold on as much as possible so their pain “is less”… but I have it all planned. A hotel room, have something I insanely allergic to, some sleeping pills. No notes because I don’t know how to explain this emptiness, this lack of wanting to wake up, this constant hating myself so much, every day, every hour, every second. I failed in life. I’ve tried therapy, I’ve tried pills, I’ve tried calendars, journals, sports, meditation. Nothing works for more than a couple of months, and I am just so tired to keep trying, to have the hope, for a couple of weeks, that perhaps yes, this time is different. I just want the sadness and the pain to stop, and I can’t find any other way. I want to sleep, I want to disappear. I don’t want to exist anymore.|hopelessness sadness worthlessness|emptiness sadness hopelessness suicide intent loneliness worthlessness
"So since april 2022 I'm seeing my first therapist because of social phobia and depression.

I really like him and I'm very glad I ended up with him and that I feel comfortable. But know I'm questioning myself if he's just nice or actually helpful. Do you know what i mean? Like he is a great person and all but what if he isn't actually helping me.

The only odd thing i can point out is that he often tells me that my social phobia could get better if im getting more independent (moving out, getting a job etc.), which is very hard to impossible for me. Why do i find this odd? Because ofc this should be a goal for me, but to reach this goal, I need to overcome my social phobia and depress; It's not possible to solve an issue with the goal itself. He also believes that i don't need medical treatment, although i do believe that and am taking.


However can u explain how I spot if he's a nice or a helpful therapist."|sadness worthlessness|sadness

I tried making an appointment with my psychiatrist today but guess who never picked up the phone. I also reached out to my therapist twice and got ignored over a month ago, so I stopped trying with that. She never says anything I don't know anyways. I need more than talk therapy. If I quit my job I'm going to have to dip into my savings and get to be a ""content creator"" to make money. I'm just so fucking exhausted.

It’s already been two years of anger and strained coparenting, and still, today was a huge setback. Their actions didn’t just make me a single mom, it also made me a part-time one, which kills me.

I’m not self diagnosing; I promise, I’m not like that. But it’s hard to ignore the symptoms currently. I’m in the middle of an emotionally abusive relationship with my father. It’s been going on for close to a year. Lately the effects have been getting more severe as the abuse has gotten worse over the past 5 months. I’ve started getting nightmares, intense anxiety when making a mistake or opening up to people in fear of being yelled at for it. I’ve had flashbacks from me crying my eyes out in a bathroom because of it or the times that he made me feel like crap and I couldn’t handle it. The times that he was at his worst have haunted me since they happened. Certain places give me intense anxiety because of bad memories of being there. I’ve had mental breakdowns, panic attacks and emotional outbursts about going over to his house (I mainly spend time at my mums but going to his house makes me feel panicky and anxious).

 People don’t look at me, they look past me, they don’t interact, don’t  approach, don’t acknowledge.

I told him I want the same last name as our children and it doesn’t make sense to me why *he* can’t understand that. His mom and dad divorced when he was young and she still has the same last name, never changed it back, so I told him to speak to his mother about her reasonings to keep the same last name to gain some perspective if that’s what he needed, but he’s essentially throwing a fit about it.

You go through a divorce, for a while (individual mileage will vary) you feel a sense of existential loss. You spend time rediscovering who you are, what your value system is, what makes you tick. You go through the throes of heartbreak, depression and angst. You deal with the waves of emotions the best you can. You work on yourself (In what whatever way works best for you) to reorientate yourself in the world, you reignite your passions and belief systems.

And then one day, it's like a switch just flips. You become happy again, you start living again. You no longer feel lost in the world. Truth be told, it does get better. Hang in there and live for you.

Her telling me that these things did in fact happen confirms that they weren’t dreams at all because I never told her about them but the stuff she described is exactly what happened in those “dreams.” I’m sorry if my writing doesn’t make sense.

(M/18) No one really wants me. And I don’t mean in any sexual way, I mean like REALLY wants me as a priority. There’s always something more important than being with me and doing stuff with me. There’s no one who wants to watch movies with me, playing games or even go for a walk. No one ever asks me if I want to meet them or talk on the phone with them. I mean, why do I even exist?

"A weekend at home together with my depressed partner and child. Should be a happy occasion he works some weekends so it's nice to be together right. But it's another morning of a lot of silence from him. Asking me if I'm ok about 20million times but not making any other conversation.

My partner is depressed he's not horrible to me he's a wonderful partner but he's just not the person I signed up to be with right now. I'm trying to be patient I'm trying to be supportive he's doing all the right things by getting help. He doesn't talk to me unless I pull teeth and I just get so exhausted of being the one having to pull us both out the funk all the time. Between my job, study and looking after our child I'm just exhausted.

Hoping in time I will get him back but the wait is so lonely. Sometimes it's easier when he's not here. How do people cope with the sadness rubbing off on them and the crippling loneliness? It never being about you and your needs?"||loneliness sadness emptiness hopelessness
Growing up, I learned to identify who was walking down the hall from a very young age.

Now I’m in my twenties with roommates, and I still freeze when I hear footsteps while I’m in my room, and immediately my mind goes into overdrive analyzing what they mean.|sadness worthlessness|brain dysfunction (forget) sadness hopelessness

I was diagnosed with depression when I was 18 and started antidepressants at 20. In the beginning it was wonderful: I was full of energy, my anxiety was gone, I could fully function in society. I started studying again, I travelled and everything was great. But it's been two years now and slowly, I have started to disappear. I live in a constant state of apathy. Where I once cared too much, right now I don't care at all. I've been doing so many stupid things just to feel something and I hardly recognise myself.

"This is my 2nd marriage. I (41f) was a single mom with a career and did not date seriously for many years after my first divorce. Decided to try online dating after a while and quickly met the man who is now my husband. My time with him was like a dream, and then it wasn't. As soon as we bought a house together, the constant praise, fun trips, inside jokes, fun. . . Just disappeared. Eventually it was replaced with what I live with now everyday. Criticism and contempt about everything I do, look like, and am. The part that really gets me is I am more successful in my career and at parenting than he is, so he is just looking for something to complain about.

I’ve been in a bit of a pickle ever since moving to  California. The insurance I have out here is pretty bad.

I went to see the “assigned” primary care practitioner after being turned away from multiple places that I picked out not knowing they wouldn’t take my insurance a couple of times now and told them how depressed I was and she just doesn’t care. I even took surveys and mentioned how bad I feel but because I won’t say that I want to unalive myself they won’t put me on antidepressants and mark all of my paperwork as “fine”.

The severity of the lows has reached an all time high and I’ve never been more comfortable with the idea of death.

I am personally working on my ability to detach from his emotions. This would’ve really upset me a few weeks ago. No I’m fine with telling him his thoughts are untrue, that I love him, and hanging up the phone to let him deal with it in his own time.

Hi friends. Have visited this page quite a lot ever since my girlfriend came out with depression and started seeking help for it. This was my first relationship and it hurts a ton. Just a month ago we went on a trip and everything seemed great. But today, she said she no longer could act like everything was fine after being diagnosed and had to take a step back and assess everything. She apparently realized that we were not compatible and she no longer feels the same way about me. However, I always thought we were very compatible especially emotionally. She also inferred she doesn't want to take me along with her constant changes in her mood and place a toll on me too. Given it's my first real relationship I am wondering if this is on me too due to a lack of experience. How do I deal with this? Anything I should look forward to?|hopelessness loneliness sadness|sadness

(Edit: This is not to say I could have saved her life my talking to her, it's that I wish I had more time with her)

I had a dream about her last night. I was sitting on the floor looking at a [picture her sister posted on Facebook,](https://imgur.com/a/NRDpp27.jpg) when she came and sat down behind me, wrapping her arms around me. I burst out in tears and we just sat there, hugging, my face resting against her arms.

I hope someone sees this. I’m NB (28) and love abroad for work. None of my family is here and I don’t interact with a lot of people outside work. I had a girlfriend and was very happy, especially because someone found me attractive and interesting. We broke up and all the people I know will be traveling. I will be spending Christmas alone since I can’t travel home. I fail at almost all my relationships and am starting to think there is something wrong with me.

I seriously don't know if people are willingly ignoring the fact that not everyone has access to therapy or if they don't believe it 

The amount of times that asked people for help and they simply said “just go to therapy” is annoying. Therapy is a privilege that not all of us have, and yes it's unfair but it's the truth, and something I would like to add is that if everyone is being put on hold by the suicide hotline, who are they saving exactly?

"Hello. 

I want to apologize in advance if any of my language or terminology is outdated or offensive. I promise it is not my intent. Please let me know if there is preferred terminology I should use instead. 

My neighbor is an older gentleman who, I believe, suffers from schizophrenia or some other mental health problem. Some nights, he will loudly and angrily talk to himself with sentences that are barely coherent, and to people who are not there. He is so far harmless, but recently the rants have included racial slurs and he has been picking up bricks and stones while ranting. It makes my friends uncomfortable, and at times it can feel unsafe.

My question is- is there someone I can call during these episodes? I don’t want to call the police, who are woefully unprepared to deal with mental health issues, but I’m worried it might escalate and he might inadvertently hurt me, my friends, or my property, or himself. Please, any advice or insight you can offer is greatly appreciated."|hopelessness sadness|anger

I got out of the “i wanna kms” and “i can barely take care of myself” type of depression like 6 months ago because I had family to help me. I have therapy, Therapist told me to sign up for this program Department of Rehabilitation to help me find a job because I was finally feeling better.

Things are finally looking up but the struggle just still never ends. I know that in my state I cannot handle normal working hours/loads. I’ve tried college but I feel as if I’m intellectually stunted at middle school level. I’m hoping that when I work I’ll feel a little better about myself not being a loser living with my parents.

Today I broke down again and told her I needed help, she told me that I can talk to her whenever I want to Wich I answered ""Don't you remember what happened the last time we talked?"" She said that she did remember, that she remember how I slapped her, when I asked her if she remembers why I did and what we were talking about a that moment she just shrugged her shoulders and asked ""What were we talking about""

I'm crushed and seriously in danger of trying to commit suicide again, if my mom doesn't even remember that her own son wants to kill himself then she obviously doesn't care enough and if she doesn't, who does?

goes hand in hand with “just move on”

also manifestation can bring into question whether my thoughts caused my trauma, and that goes deeper into more feelings of blame and guilt.

She insisted i was angry and making a fuss when i just asked. 

I then said i’m done. She tried to INSTANTLY make it seem like she had broken up with me. I then saw a post about how valuable peace is. I reposted it. Her friend or someone must have shown her it.

"Ok, so I've been heavily depressed for the good part of 6 years now and last year I started getting suicidal. When my ""dad"" found out he sat me down and told me to ""buck the fuck up"". He said that my life is too good for this, what could I POSSIBLY want MORE of, and that his own life is much harder than mine so I need to ""man up"" and appreciate what I have. 

I understand where he's coming from. Gratitude can be very helpful to people who are feeling depressed, but I already know and am thankful for what I have. This whole situation is made worse when I can't tell him that he's probably the reason for the depression and suicidal thoughts as a result of his relentless psychological, physical, and mental abuse everyday since I was 2.

I'm not quite sure what to do as I want therapy but he not only doesn't want me to get it but he also used to be a psychologist for 10 years so he can't be persuaded that he's wrong.

I can’t afford any medical or dental for my millions of health issues, nor to get a psychiatrist who can properly diagnose me and get me the medication I desperately need.

I just want you to look after me. I want you to go to the pharamacy and not tell me how you're feeling about it. The amount of times I've done it for him when I've been extremely unwell but never tell him because I know it would make him feel shit.

"Last month I had an appointment that I had to book out TWO months in advance. From then on, my next appointment is a month and a half away. Out of all the things to make people wait for, this is probably one of if not the WORST. Does the government or anyone with any position of power understand the consequences of making people who are trying to get their mental health examined wait long periods of time? More funding needs to be put into this. (also I wish society was less toxic and 'edgy' towards each other but I digress)

I myself am doing okay but I can't imagine the pain others go through when they're told that they have to wait several weeks or even months to get their next appointment and how agonizing it can be.

Comments like this are why men rarely - if ever - come forward about being abused.  Men are very often emotionally, verbally, financially, and yes, even physically and sexually abused by their partner, both male and female.  All too often, abuse towards men is dismissed or even ridiculed.  If I came on here and told a woman that maybe she should've cooked his steak and she wouldn't have a black eye, I would get railed by others, and rightfully so.  When a man says that he was berated by his woman because he didn't clean something correctly, why is it okay to criticize him and make it his fault?

Shut-In: I have every opportunity to indulge in peaceful solitude without fear of social disturbance. I can be sad, I can be inspired, I can be creative, and I can go through my normal feelings without interruption from anyone

Alternative: I keep working this unfulfilling full time job with people who are best case indifferent towards me and worst case despise me so that I can go home and wallow in societally based stress and anxiety only to repeat it consistently for the rest of time"|hopelessness loneliness sadness|sadness loneliness
Hi I’m 25F and I feel sad quite a lot. Sitting and violently crying seems to become more regular over the past 5 years. However I do wonder if it’s ‘depression’. I’ve tried life style change, diet, new job, new friends, new city, herbal remedies, non herbal remedies anything u can think of to feel happy I’ve tried. It makes me wonder if it’s something in my brain instead of environment. However I can be happy. I would say 3/7 days oc the week I am okay. But the other four are filled with dark thoughts and misery. I ask if this is classed as depression as I was looking to reach out but didn’t want to waste NHS time if it wasn’t etc. or go through the effort of it just for it to be a natural thing to feel|hopelessness loneliness sadness|sadness

I had a suicidal breakdown last night. I texted my therapist and she urged me to go to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. After coming clean to my parents about my intense suicidal idealization, the crisis calmed down a bit and I decided that I wanted to sleep in my own bed (I was tired and didn’t want to spend 5 hours in the ER waiting) and to go in the morning. I woke up this morning to my cat curled up next to me. He rarely sleeps with me. I think he knows that I wasn’t okay. He’s like my guardian cat, watching guard over me to make sure I’m okay and be my companion so I could look over at him, pet him, and feel a small twinge of love for something. Happiness isn’t the right word, I don’t think I’m capable of feeling happiness right now. But when I look at my cats, I feel like maybe there is something, even if it small, that’s worth living for.

When you commit suicide usually you believe with all your heart that everyone in the world would be better off without you or that they don't care. It is the most unselfish thing I can think of.

Sometimes, it is worse, and sometimes it is gone, but lately, what I'm feeling is not just depression but a big fear of being alive. The idea of being alive makes me horrified and makes me want to cry, mostly because it doesn't feel as if I'm alive. What does it mean to be alive? The more I think about it, the worse I feel, and the more I want to stop being alive, but the idea of dying is also horrible. I feel that I'm stuck in a horrible, scary, and dark limbo.|hopelessness worthlessness|sadness worthlessness suicide intent
"I'm suicidal, but not *suicidal.*

In other words, I'm not ""suicidal""-suicidal.

Know what I mean?

That's not to say I'm doing it for attention, though, either. (That's a common assumption/misconception). My pain is very real. My feelings of wanting to die are pretty genuine.

Basically:

**I was just wondering if there was anyone else out there who, like me, has decided *not* to kill oneself—essentially, to continue living—despite the persistence of suicidal thoughts/feelings/ideations/wishes.**

I will not kill myself.

But some days, I really don't want to be alive anymore."|hopelessness sadness worthlessness|hopelessness sadness suicide intent loneliness brain dysfunction (forget)
"I have PTSD from a traumatic and abusive childhood. I don’t know if the PTSD  and anger at being repetitively touched are related, but I’m trying to find some answers or at least someone who experiences the same thing. 

When someone taps me repetitively, pats me, or touches me repetitively in any way I am INSTANTLY enraged and intensely anxious. My heart rate spikes, I have to consciously prevent myself from lashing out, and I want to cry. But if someone touches me once with firm pressure, I’m completely fine. It’s not that I hate being touched across the board. It’s just the repetitive touching.  

Does anyone else experience this?"|anger sadness|anger

"No infidelity, no verbal/physical abuse. Just “we grew apart and I love you but I’m not in love with you anymore.” 

I should feel devastated, but now that it’s been a month since I was asked for a divorce…I realize that my marriage hasn’t changed at all. My wife in the divorce process is exactly the same as our entire marriage. She is kind of nice,but 0 intimacy and me existing generally kind of annoys her. Nothing is any different from any point when we were married. 

I feel kind of okay with it. I want my partner to be into me and into some of the things I like. Not just perma-annoyed, grumpy and constant sighing in between doom scrolling. 

Im excited to get out of sex jail and not be a general annoyance to the person I love. Maybe someone who likes talking to me more than scrolling Instagram. 

I feel like I’m waiting for this wave of devastation but it’s just not coming. Am I in denial or am I actually okay?"|anger emptiness hopelessness loneliness sadness|sadness hopelessness loneliness emptiness anger worthlessness brain dysfunction (forget)

"TW vague suicidal ideation  

My support network is unavailable because I trauma dumped on my friend too recently and haven’t reciprocated any support over the last year, and realistically there’s nothing she can do.

It’s like a release valve. I change it to be like one after. My favourite track so far is wild international by one day as a lion.

*You are eligible to participate if you:*

*-* *Are 18 or older*

*-* *Live with a partner or spouse who has been diagnosed with depression* 

*-* *Are not depressed yourself*

When emotions come up I just go on my phone and get stuck in a rabbit hole that suppresses any type of feeling. I know it’s not healthy. I want to change. I always tell myself I’ll get better for myself, and I never do. I don’t understand how I can keep letting myself down like this. I don’t deserve it. But I can’t help it. I want to wake up feeling happy and full of life but I never do. It always feels like there’s a dark cloud looming above me during mornings.

I deal with stress with anger, and I vent that through other less damaging means, usually in a gym or something, so I'm unsure on what exactly I should be saying. I feel she hides it from me sometimes, either cause she's ashamed or scared of hurting me. She has really bad times and right now we're going through one of them, where she is saying she feels alone and powerless, as well as everything going too fast and she can't keep up with the world.

I basically said

1. being racist is definitely not okay
2. Just because other people are racist to you you shouldn't be racist to them
3. If someone is racist to you stand up for your self and call them out on it.

My parents the said I need to get out of the world and face real life... I already have a job and working on my own business and that I'm to young to understand how things work... fuck dude I'm an adult.

Perhaps, if there is no solution to loneliness, what is the next step? What would we have to learn from loneliness in order to accommodate ourselves to a happy life? Hell, what would a Zen monk do in this case?"|loneliness|loneliness

So I found out a couple days ago that the men that used to babysit me and my four sisters would molest us. This was confirmed separately by three out of four because I was only four when he went to prison for production and possession of meth. I recently had a pap done and the doctor talked to me about the scar tissue in my vagina because sex has always been painful for me. I have zero memory of anything from before I was about nine when I was playing on an engine lift and it dropped on my head. How do I process this? I'm still kind of in denial and I keep thinking ""at least I dont remember it"" but like also not knowing feels kinda terrifying. Like what did he do to me, did this happen? Is this just coincidental? What else dont I remember? I also have physical conditions that this has been exacerbating. Has anyone else delt with this?

I find it ironic that the world says anyone that's struggling with mental health problems should speak out, but when we try to talk to someone & seek help we're labelled as liars & attention seekers. I've struggled with depression & anxiety since I was 12 but wasn't diagnosed until I was 19 because if I tried to open up about how I was feeling I was instantly dismissed; doctors said it's probably just puberty, friends & family said I was just being a typical moody teenager. So I just kept everything bottled up & pushed it down which only made it all worse. No one seemed to listen or give a shit until one day I accidentally rolled up my hoodie sleeves in front of my mum, she saw the cuts & scars covering both of my forearms. I had been doing that for 2 years without it being noticed by anyone. She asked why I didn't come to her. I simply ecplained that I had tried but no one listened or seemed to care.

"Does anyone else find it infuriating that after years of trying to empower someone to make changes (drinking,substance abuse, etc) and once you finally decide to leave all of a sudden they are able to start making changes?? 

After more than half a decade together and years of his drinking doing harm to the relationship, me trying to meet him where he’s at, supporting him and being patient, I finally realize I can’t do it anymore. I’m the type of person who once a decision is made, it’s made. I rarely go back. He knows that. And once I finally communicated that decision, all of a sudden days later he decides he’s going to be sober and get fit and work on the things I had BEGGED him to work on?

I think most people who feel lonely, or been lonely for a long time, have a strength to be able to be alone. We've dealt/are currently dealing with it. And being able to spend time alone and be okay-ish, is a pretty strong thing to have. 

I know feeling lonely might be very destructive and it sucks up all your energy, but you're also building a strength in way i think.. also, maybe being it's an opportunity for u to do whatever the fuck you want with your time, and even show other people what u like to do, so maybe at some point they'd wanna be your friends just because they might like things that you like.."||loneliness
"So my severely depressed ex came back into my life, and I can tell he really is trying his hardest to do better and to have open communications with me whenever he is feeling down or needing space. We've been together for about 3 years in the past, and even had a few on and offs in this relationship. But I love him and even with the time apart we had, I never once stopped, and I do believe him but how can you get past the fact that at any moment they can revert back to their depressed self that pushes everyone away? That's my biggest fear is that while we are taking things slow and both doing our best to understand and learn from each other (him as the one needing support and me being the one to show support) how we can best explain ourselves and make ourselves feel understood with each other.

"It’s like a recipe for disaster. It’s like one moment you were somebody they cared deeply about and appreciated. The next minute a episode hits and they tell you that you deserve better.

They progressively get colder and more distant. They begin to criticize you project their feeling on to you and make you seem like the bad guy. Meanwhile friends see a completey masked “happy” version of them. You feel alienated further and further and eventually want out. Then you get push and pull behaviors which just add more damage. Eventually so much resentment has built that you escape and they lash out for “abandoning” them.

You end up carrying the emotional pain of feeling like you abandoned someone in their time of need. It’s like you completely forget that their behavior caused this. Whether purposely or subconsciously they did this doesn’t matter. Depression will distort the sufferers thinking and view your actions as “selfish” when you have tried your hardest to be empathetic and understanding."|hopelessness sadness worthlessness|sadness brain dysfunction (forget) hopelessness worthlessness

"Trigger warning: suicide

Today I was in tears and closed my bedroom door and started tying a hangman’s Knot. All of a sudden my cat stuck his paw under my door and grabbed the rope, pulled it all under and ran away with it.

Hi all, I was wondering if any of you divorced due to your spouse having issues with your appearance?  If so, did you regret it?  Long story short….my husband asked me to promise not to believe in divorce before we got married.  I started gaining weight.  He then started asking me for a divorce at least three times a month fir four years.  I am finally losing weight and he still asks for one, but an hour or two later he will act like he never said anything and want hugs and kisses.  He also denies the math on his requests, but I am being generous.  After 4 years of this, I think I need to break the cycle because he NEVER follows through with the actual divorce.  I ordered a quick online one, but it was written incorrectly so I never mailed it back.  I also worry about losing the shared income as I am nearing 40.

After about a month of separation, my gf wants to get back together. Since I’ve been given the time to step away from the relationship I’ve realized how stressful it was to be in the relationship. (She has depression, anxiety, and ptsd). Don’t get me wrong I love her, so much so that i put her many times before myself. This break made me realize that every time I was going through something, be it a relatives death or life event, she repeatedly wasn’t there for me. Makes me question whether or not to get back together. I know it couldn’t have been easy for her because how can you be supportive for someone when you’re struggling yourself but sometimes I just think that I always put her above my needs and now I’m just realizing I don’t know if I can continue.

If I cried or panicked and told him to stop he would be harsher but then after he would tell me to calm down and that was normal and every bf does that, even some parents discipline their kids like that (which is true my Tio disciplines my cousins like that) I would believe I was overreacting after and let it go.

I just tell them it's something that I live with/deal with and it can cause me to react in certain ways. I don't know why but every single time without fail, the first thing they ask is ""what happened?"". Every time I have to explain to them that if my past trauma can trigger me, then what prevents me from getting triggered by just talking about it? Why would I relive my trauma just to tell you what happened?

I know they don't mean it in a harmful way, but please. People need to learn to not ask this. Me telling you I have PTSD/CPTSD should be enough and leave it at that. If it's impolite and rude to ask a crippled person how they got that way then why do people think it's okay to ask a victim of trauma how they ended up traumatized??"|anger hopelessness worthlessness|anger

This old friend and I have not spoken in the last two years due to disagreements and realizing that we have a lot of differences. However, this friend was someone that was supportive in times of need as I was to her. I reached out when I was in a dark place and asked her to talk as I did not know what else to do and knew I needed to reach out to someone, but was embarrassed to reach out to certain people because they have never seen me this way. Long story short, she never responded. This has just made me hurt worse. Like she truly doesn’t care about me at all.

You want everyone and nothing you want to be happy and yet you also just want it to all go away and stay away, the worst part is when you still manage to function, you get up and eat and drink and work and chat… but at night, you feel that numbness, the craving for something other than this emptiness, slowly carving away from the inside out, too slow to notice by eye without a Timelapse…

Like most people, 2020 was a wreck of a year that had a high cost. Not just financially but mentally/emotionally.

The other day I found myself in a dark situation I was able to get myself out of....but I want to avoid going back to that dark mental place.

I really believe that if I had a group of other individuals who feel alone, isolated, suicidal, depressed, anxious, stressed and so much more - that through that connection and regular community I wouldn’t find myself in a dark place again.

Does anyone know of any support programs where the members meet virtually on a weekly or bi-weekly basis?"|loneliness|loneliness suicide intent sadness hopelessness

My wife was very unfaithful the last year of marriage. After the divorce finalized in March, she dumped her boyfriend, and came to see me. We had a two week fling, it seemed great until all my resentment about past infidelity came out. I was willing to try, but she wasn't, as soon as I was critical of her, she bounced. She went back to her boyfriend. The other day I heard she was getting married, after dating this dude for less than a year. She moved into his house, doesn't pay any bills, and has become a de facto mother to his children. It all seemed so phony to me. I wondered if the new guy knew about our little fling we had while they were 'broken up'. I found him on social media and let him know. The next day I got a bunch of angry texts from my ex mother in law about how I'd ruined their engagement. Part of my motivation was to let the guy know what he was getting into, but another part was pure spite. Ive never enacted revenge in such an extreme way before. I'm not sure how I feel about it.|anger hopelessness|anger sadness
"A few months ago, I left my narcissistic husband after months of planning. The emotional abuse had definitely done a number on me and our child was also feeling the effects. 

Some of the things he shouted at me the first time I tried to leave after I uncovered his affair, which was the absolute last straw, were: 

“You can’t afford to leave!”
“You have nowhere else to go!”
“If you leave you won’t have healthcare!”

My second attempt was carefully planned. I saved up, got a car in my name, moved in with family until I could find an apartment. 

I’m alone on Christmas Eve, cleaning and painting my new apartment. I’m singing at the top of my lungs and I have so much joy in my heart and hope for my future. I can’t wait to bring my child here and create new, beautiful memories. 

Merry Christmas, everybody. "|anger hopelessness worthlessness|loneliness

My daughter (18) had/has depression for some time. Her therapist recommended she start Zoloft a couple years ago. The side effects were significant for her the first and second time she got back on them. She did well after getting on them the 2nd time then she left for school and went off them again. I noticed and she told me about feeling bad again so during break I encouraged her to get back on her medication. This third time getting on them she's had really bad side effects, the worst of all the times she returned to the medication. Now, she thinks it's so bad she doesn't want to go through the week or so it takes for the side effects to subside. I'm worried. I think she needs to be on her medication and im afraid for her thinking she will be ok without them as I've already noticed she seems to be more depressed. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

"I was ranting in my room about roommates I had in another country when I suddenly heard an angry yell outside my bedroom door. I opened the door and then saw that angry old guy who exclaimed a few unintelligible words with an angry expression on his face. He believed I was ranting about him - but I explained I was not. He literally got so upset by the rant, and of course totally embarrassed himself, that he went to bed angry. I just found it hilarious how this old man acts like an insecure, narcissistic teenager who thinks everyone is talking about him.

Please, he's not even worth the time nor attention for a conversation. *eye roll* It was too funny not to share.

"We’ve both grown up. After years of being so angry and afraid of some threat bigger than me, I realized after seeing her that she didn’t scare me anymore. That this big bad wolf in my head was just another kid like me. 

I cried on the way home. Not from fear, but from relief. She apologized and told me that she didn’t expect forgiveness. That’s something no one who’s hurt me ever said. She’s gotten so much better. I realized that she was also just an abused kid. 

I found closure in that aspect of my trauma. My other abusers, I will never see again or get an apology from, but this one I did. I’ve been a lot better since. My mood swings aren’t as violent and I’m better at calming down.

Most of my entire life was spent suffering from discrimination from my family, abuse, and poverty. As an adult, things got better but it took a long time of getting through so much mental hang ups and dealing with chronic pain. I isolated myself and missed out in experiencing life. I feel heartbroken pretty much all the time.I wished I could have had a normal life. To see others have birthday parties and be embraced by their friends leaves me so lost. I can’t really relate to others and I feel totally accustomed to being on my own. I don’t know how to get out of this rut.|hopelessness loneliness sadness|sadness loneliness emptiness hopelessness worthlessness
When I reflect on my relationship with my partner and from looking at the shared similarities of all these post I can’t help but wonder do our partners truly love us for us or for what we bring to the table? Im not sure if your partners need constant assurance and or suffer from constant low self esteem but it just feels sometimes like my partner could never love me if she didn’t love herself. If you have insight on this I would love to hear I’m in no way trying to generalize I’m realizing this can come off this way but I’m lost rn as to what I’ve had to experience and many other people on this subreddit seem to experience this as well|hopelessness worthlessness|sadness
"My (30M) girlfriend (31F) and I are finally separating after 4.5 years together and 2.5 years living together. Although the actual moving out process is very messy, it has been a huge relief for me to not feel responsable for solving her problems and I can solely focus on myself for the first time in a long time. 

Three months ago she asked for space for herself (triggered by events outside our relationship) which then turned into her wanting to move out then eventually breakup. During the process she started regularly seeing another guy and eventually spending a long weekend away with him in a different city. This was the breaking point for me and gave me clarity to go ahead and move on as she could only apologize for how she handled telling me, not for what she was doing. 

Although it is difficult seeing her in this deep depressive state and I intend to end on good terms with her, I feel like I was delaying her process of getting help and am hopeful this will help her reach out to her friends and start back regularly with therapy again."|hopelessness sadness|sadness
"Hi everyone

I posted the other day here about how I was on the brink of considering leaving my depressed SO. I sought the consultation with my friends who were generally sympathetic and agreed with my line of thinking. 

However, she woke up changed and was in a good mood, was pleasant to be around and getting actively involved in our activities.

At first, I was relieved and began to rethink whether I really had to leave her, and then I reread my post and was reminded how she can make me feel during one of her episodes.

I think I struggle a lot with the constant yo-yo, as this consequently makes my mood yo-yo and contributes to a feeling of uncertainty, and the inability to plan anything with the confidence that we'll both have a good time. It feels like my whole life centres around her moods sometimes. It's very tiring. Can anyone else relate to this feeling?"|hopelessness sadness worthlessness|sadness
"My mom is ridiculous. If I yell when she's verbally attacking me I'm the bad guy. If I lower my voice, take responsibility for my part and hold her accountable I'm ""not her counselor"" and I'm ""psychoanalyzing her"". No matter what I do I'm wrong. She expects me to bow my head like a child just accept that I'm always wrong in all things that I don't agree with and I know that's not true.

I've made posts about her insane demands that had hundreds of people going ""what the hell? Dude that is not normal.""

She's literally allowed her PTSD to consume her personality. She's 100% a victim in all things and I'm the bad guy. 

I honestly can't wait to cut her off.

It frustrates me that people who don’t suffer from mental health issues don’t understand that it is a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week deal. You can’t just turn it off, and it’s not as simple as talking to a therapist a few times and feeling better. It isn’t that easy. They all say “oh, I’ve been there”, but have you? Do you REALLY, being honest with yourself, KNOW what it’s like to suffer all day every day and have people blame you for something you cannot help, and make assumptions about you because of it? If you had “been there”, I’d hope you’d be more understanding at least. But you aren’t. Because you haven’t “been there”, and you don’t “get it”. Stop fooling yourself and maybe LISTEN rather than taking over the conversation and silencing those who ACTUALLY suffer in favour of presenting theories on what you think it’s like.|anger hopelessness worthlessness|anger hopelessness
Knowing that I won’t be here for much longer. That it’s a matter of if not when I commit suicide. The fact that when it’s done I won’t be in pain anymore. Knowing that there’s nothing on the other side to worry about, no negativity, no pain, nothing. All of it comforts me. I can’t wait to die. I think about killing myself everyday. Hopefully it won’t be that much longer.||emptiness suicide intent hopelessness worthlessness

I’m 19 and my life is already awful. I live with chronic pain that has torn apart my life. I’m stuck on painkillers that cause withdrawal if I miss a dose, I don’t have a high school diploma as I was kicked out my jr year.

On top of my chronic pain I have severe sleep apnea to the point anytime I sleep I could have a stroke, heart attack, or just fuckin die. The machine that would prevent that is too expensive for me to buy and cover. Having to come with you’re own mortality that quick gives you a feeling of emptiness. I don’t seek out anything anymore. What’s the point if I’m gonna kick the bucket before anyone I care about. I’ve been going to a therapist and she’s made it clear I have trouble feeling good emotions, I no longer understand how they feel.
