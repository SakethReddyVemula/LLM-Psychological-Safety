"Wouldn't it be sad if from the time we were born we knew exactly where we would end up in life? I personally don't believe in fate, but it might just be because I don't want to think that I don't have control in the outcome and direction of my own personal life. I enjoy being able to think that if I wanted to, I could completely change everything, and nothing would be predetermined.  But at the same time I can't help but wonder if my life will end up the same way no matter what.

"France and the Allies celebrated last week end one of the most fantastic military operations ever made in the world. Never so much depended on so few courageous soldiers wo sacrified to free a continent they didn't know. I'm 26 and i knom i'm living in a free land thanks to brave young men who fought for what they believe to be right. I will always love this America but i can help thinking that today America is on the wrong way. America's grief is justified, America is right to launch attacks against a faceless ennemy who wants to burn the whole world but this fight can be boiled down to a fight between evil and good, to a crusade against barbarians, it will be dangerous and counterproductive. Europe knows how complex is the world, europe knows how high is the price of blood and Europe doesn't want to be part of the wrong war. The United States are our closest friends and friends don't have to agree on everything. On the contrary, i will be happy if my friends tell me that i'm about to make a huge mistakes, that i act like a fool. I will be very thankful and i will accept this lend hand... because i don't want to stumble and fall in the Depths

"I am currently reading a book called ""Prayer Walking"" The concept is to strengthen you body as well as your soul. Hmmm...I think I am going to give this book a try. I do need to prayer more and get a stronger prayer life, and I do need to lose some weight. But in order to do this, I will have to get up early and actually get out there and walk. I think, once I am done with the book, I will actually get started. I will have to let you know how it goes.  Church yesterday was awesome! We had a powerful move of God and a total refreshing swept through the church. It was amazing! During last nights service, I got all the girls in the youth group up at the front dancing and jumping. It was such a great time in the Lord. Those girls are so special and God is doing great things in their lives.

"So we did the Oklahoma thing.  It was actually a very beautiful lake.  On Saturday, as soon as we got into OK, it started pouring.  We were worried that our fun-filled weekend would be ruined because of the rain.  We had nothing to do.  We decided to see DODGEBALL, which was silly.  When we came out of the movies, the sun was out and the sky started to clear.  We dashed over to the lake to rent a kayak.  It was really nice and not too hot since it had been raining all day.  We then ate dinner at a local restaurant.   Sunday's weather was better.  My husband enjoyed the scuba diving, though it was not my cup of tea.  I am not certified and just sat on the shore, under the trees, trying to avoid the sun.  I told him that I might not go with him the next time he decided to dive, since it is not very interesting for me.  I know he enjoys it so much, but is definitely not a spectator sport.   I am teaching classes in a summer program for high school students.  It is going well, though some of the kids don't seem to care very much about the program.  They seem to be determined to get kicked out of the program (which will provide college tuition upon successful completion ).  I don't know.  Hopefully these kids will wake up and realize that this is a unique opportunity before they are removed.  I know that they deal with difficult stuff at home - things that I never had to deal with. . . .

"A kindergarten teacher gave her class a ""show and tell"" assignment. Each student was instructed to bring in an object to share with the class that represented their religion.

"Today was a good day...i went to church, learned some good stuff...and i saw you there.  You were setting there, as beautiful as ever, and i was happy.  Later everyone went to the lake, i enjoyed that, espacially the service, were i sat in your shadow.  If you only cared for me the way i do for you...ohh, what a love that would be.  I've been waiting for a while, but that doesn't matter, my feelings for you haven't dissapated, i doubt they will.  Your the first person i think of when i wake up, and the first person i pray for, before i sleep....what a love this could be.  countless hours spent dreaming of you, but whats sad, is that your in love with another, and there is nothing i can do to stop it.

"ANGEL        I don’t think much about it anymore, but there was a time I couldn’t get it out of my head.     It was a day I didn’t think I would survive, the metropolis of intuition that was vacuumed in my mind was endless.  I wanted to get it out and fast.  I hate myself when I am so inconsistent and incoherent.  I am in a state that cannot be reversed or understood.  I can’t remedy it.     Sex was never as good with her as it was in my mind.     There is nothing like cotton t-shirt sheets.     I feel creative but can’t understand why.  It’s been months since I have written.     The sunlight wakes me again, and I want to die.     I hear Massive Attack in my head…..the soft ambient noise in my mind that seems to always be there.  Angel, Angel, Angel.  I love that girls voice.

"Cameron woke up at 4:00 a.m. from a strange noise coming from the kitchen. She thought it must have been Mrs. Chives from upstairs doing something. Cameron is a cautious girl, so she got up to check it out, just in case. She grabbed her pepper spray from the drawer of her bedside table and slowly walked towards the kitchen door. She pushed the door half way open, quietly, and stuck her head inside. She looked around the kitchen, but didn't see anything. Being annoyed by the whole ordeal, she dragged herself back to bed. She almost fell asleep again, untill she heard someone humming at the end of the hallway, with a woman's voice. Cameron is also a very down-to-earth girl, so she tried to find a reasonable explenation for it... it's like a reflex. ""Maybe someone is lost or something..."" she said to herself in a trembling voice. The humming sound kept getting louder and more intence, and the room got a bit cold. Her bedroom door was half open, and the only thing that lit up the room a bit was the moonlight, shining through the window. She kept staring at the hallway and breathing heavily, listening to the humming sound. She thought of asking who it is, but she wasn't that bold. Out of the darkness from the hallway, she could see two bright red eyes... she just sat up on her bed and had her eyes wide open. She didn't know what to do, so she panicked. She closed her eyes tight and tried to convince herself that it was just a dream. As soon as she opened them, she saw a shadowy figure standing at the foot of her bed, with the bright red eyes. It whispered something to her, but she couldn't understand it, mostly because she was terrified and extremely anxious. It reached over to Cameron's face, and she could see it's hand in the moonlight, it was as white as snow. Before she could do anything, her window opened and someone jumped inside! The figure with the red eyes turned, facing the other person. It started hissing, and it vanished in thin air. Cameron couldn't believe her eyes!      Who is that someone who saved her?   Did you like my story so far??? If you want to find out who that person is and what that creature was doing there, read my next post!!! ;)

"Well, here I am. I decided to start a blog. Now, I am not entirely sure why I decided this for a number of reasons. 1. I am rubbish at writing journals/diaries/most things, so this is not going to be very good 2. I don’t really know anyone on this thing so no one is actually going to read it, but I guess it might be therapeutic...or something 3. I live a relatively boring life, so there is not going to be that much to write in here.  So apart from all them, this seemed like a good idea at the time!  A few days ago I came back from a holiday in America. America is awesome. If you ever get a chance to go, you should. And if you’ve already been then... go again! I had a simply marvellous time! Visited both New York and Orlando... had to go to Disneyland. new York is like no where else, I stupidly thought London was a big, busy, over-crowded city, but it is nothing next New York City. I am not sure if I would want to return, as i have now done the whole statue of liberty, show on Broadway, baseball game thing... but saying that I do think I would like to go back with a bunch of mates and just go crazy! Florida was... well... hot. And heat does not like me much. Therefore I tried to avoid it by standing under lots of fans. Despite this, I still managed to get heat rash and a severe case of sun burn. I think the sun does this to me on purpose. I also discovered that universal studios is better than Disney land... I couldn’t tell you if the rides at Disney land are better than those at universal studios, mainly due to the fact that I couldn’t get on half of the rides at Disney due to the immense amount of queuing it would have taken. Queuing that I can not be arsed to do.  Hmm... this is the end of my first entry. I do not want to end it here as I do not think i have really told people much, but my brain works in mysterious ways... possibly through the use of 3.5 small monkeys and lots of sticky tape... but however it works, it does not want to think of any more to write right now.

"Church was so much fun last night especially when we had the banana and orange eating contest.  You might be asking why it was so much fun, well the reason why is because you could only use one hand to eat both of them and I beat 4 other people!   Levi, Jessi, Joni, AJ, and everyone else knows how fun that was.  After church I went to one of bestest friends house, we ended up staying up until like 5 in the morning!  We ate Burger King for dinner and had Taco Bell at like 2am.  When we got to the window at Taco Bell we could not stop laughing, I wonder if the guy thought we were high (Levi knows what I'm like at 2am lol).  That's about all that we did.   Hey Sarah!  It was so good to see you at church, since I haven't seen you your graduation party.  Next time that I talk to you I will tell you who the peom is about.

He is hilarious. Most of his part is him just making stuff up off the top of his head.  He is 18 and acts like a 15 year old.  Today he tackled me, it was so funny because I play insulted him and he jumped me. We called a truse after that but kept messing around.    most of my friends are guys.  I don't really know why but they are.  I just feel really comfortable around them.  When I am around girls all they do is gossip and talk about you behind your back.  But guys are not like that at all, except for the gay ones but I only have one gay friend.  The guys I hang out with are usually what people call geeks or nerds or whatever you want to call them.

"Awoke this morning to a text message from Rob, obviously sent before he went on his way to Alton Towers.  Decided not to get up straightaway though, a mistake in itself as when I did get up I'd got a raging headache!  Managed to get my car cleaned and dried just as it started to rain, ah well...at least it's looking better than it was.  Btw, the text is a little bit too risque to publish on here, but it referred to the frolics of yesterday afternoon. *blushes*     Got someone else coming to see the house later this afternoon...a first-time lady buyer apparently.  Seems like the influx of Londoners coming into the sticks hasn't ceased as this is the fourth so far.  I just find it weird really that there have been ""so many"" of them...mustn't complain though if they're interested in buying the place.     Found out today that Helen is changing her car next week from the Corsa to a People Carrier type vehicle.  Not sure what it is as yet, but I'll get to see it sooner or later!

And the score was always so close not more than 6 i think, both team are having a hard time trying to score but because they were taller and bigger in size so we reaili had a hard time fighting for the rebound.

"Living in California I discovered a wonderful sport - Rugby. I know, I know what you must be thinking. Extreme pain. Trust me, the way girls play, it's not painful. It's like tackle football with the guys back in the South. If you don't want to land on the ground, just find somebody and land on them.  I can run pretty fast, so I'm a center (in a full squad of Rugby I play outside Center). Summer 7's (that's 7 minute halves, with 7 players on a full field) is geared for the backs and I absolutely love it! It's the closest I'll come to playing contact football, without the protection (mouth guard is it baby).  I play with some of the girls on the San Jose State team. They are a bit whacked (yes, Virg, I'm talking about you, and you Kelly). Last year on Thursday nights we'd practice on the beach then head over to the Beach Boardwalk and ride the roller coaster (and while most people hung on to the safety bar, Virg hung onto her breast, to each their own, I guess, Virg you little freak).   So far, on our first tourney we won all three games. I was unable to play because I popped a blood vessel in my eye.  I know what you are thinking - Ew.   Trust me, I ran for my phone so fast to call my eye doctor, Holy Toledo. I wasn't in pain, just had this HUGE bubble of blood in my eyeball, well, that's gone but there is a sea of blood around my eye now.  Of course I now go around freakin' everyone out. My rugger mates told me to come up with a creative story, that taking my contact out wasn't good enough... so here goes:  Two guys, one small room, very little time...

"Hello and blessed be to all! Well, this is the beginning of my new journal. I had one on AOL, but for personal reasons moved my writings of my escapades to BloggerLand. I've also had numerous physical journals and I've only recently started online journals. As you can see, I love to write. It is one of my greatest passions and sometimes I must write to feel better.  I'm also just as passionate about history, theater, and Paganism. So I guess you could call me a Pagan writer-actor-historian.   Lil' bit bout myself: My name's Brian and I'm 17, living in Hartford, CT. I go to Bulkeley High School and the Academy of the Arts, and I'm overall happy with that. I'm a senior now, and life doesn't seem any different. I guess it's because of my up bringing that I feel like that. You see, I live with my mother, stepfather, and three brothers and our family's pretty boring. For all you kids out there with no siblings, I HATE you. You are too lucky. Siblings-especially brothers-can be a pain in the arse. Trust me, I have three of them!!   A couple of things have made my existence a bit more bearable. Firstly, my faith. I am a proud and out-of-the-broom-closet Pagan who loves the Great Mother. I've been Pagan for five years, and my specialty is healing and the Tarot. I have more Pagan books than I don't know who, and for the most part they were worth the money. I'm also blessed with the gift of the arts. I have dabbled in just about all the arts: painting, photography, songwriting, puppetry, but my two favorites are theater and writing. Though I don't want to be a professional actor, I still at least want to be an  amateur  actor; amateurism deserves more dedication than a hobby, but not as much as a profession.  I just love the theater, but being a professional actor is too harsh a life for me. I want to be a history professor. It isn't as exciting as being an actor, but I love it nonetheless. It is also a very flexible career, and it'll allow me to write--my other passion.     I hope to one day be a published author, but right now I'm just writing. I usually never finish a story or elaborate an idea, but at least I'm writing it down. Eh? I write all kinds of shtuff, but short stories are my speciality. As I continue to write in my journal, I'll slip in a piece or two to entertain any and all.    Well, that's enough writing for now. Enjoy my escapades!!

"Today I write on were I live, but I think I shall start with were I am from. I give you this information so that when you read my future commentaries, you will understand why I think the things I do.     I grew up in the metropolitan city of Tulsa, Oklahoma, born in 1979 and lived there until I was 18 years old. My school career consisted of living and learning with the same group of kids from Elementary~High School (give or take a few). I made many friends and lived within a social standard that rated second to none. I had everything I wanted, popularity and a social stance that should make Barbie jealous. There I was happy. After graduation I decided to move to Atlanta, Georgia (good old Hotlanta). There I lived for 2 years among my father's side of the family within a few miles of where I stayed. Atlanta was beautiful and had a lot to offer to someone seeking a professional business career, but it had it's down side too. I soon found that the night life was too enticing to ignore, and I knew I would break myself long before any good could come of the situation. With that, I moved to Michigan. As a child I would come up every summer to a small lake located between a small city and an even smaller township. I had always thought (then) that I would move to the lake and have a life of lake living and contentment upon knowing people with a higher stature and career driven lifestyles.           Now, after all that back ground I can finally tell you my stories of what I would like to call, ""As the village turns.""

"The city I work in, which feels and seems much more like a town, has a courthouse square downtown.  There is a big courthouse surrounded by a fair bit of grassy area with lots of trees, a beautiful little spot really.  It really adds to the whole town feeling.  All sorts of things happen in the town square: art festivals, performing art festivals, food & drink tasting, local merchant festival, and many more.    Well, one thing I've noticed since I started working downtown is that people (men mainly) like to take a mid-day nap in this courthouse square.  I lived outside of new Orleans before I moved here, so at first I thought these nappers were homeless people, untill I paid a little more attention to them.  The majority of these napping people are wearing clean, well kept clothes, and are clean-shaven.  In other words, they are just people who live/work around downtown who like a little afternoon nap.  They pick a tree, lay down, and just doze off for a little while.  I find that kind of interesting.

Well, ok.. maybe in some cases when I go partying with my friends… but then again, they offer to pick me up.. I didn’t force them, did I? Did I?? Malaysia has lots of public transports to choose from.. so, why the worries??   Consider this…    Men prefer their women to be more independent. You are independent if you know how to drive. I do not know how to drive.    Can someone tell me where’s the validity to the above statement?? Can anyone see the logic?? I don't think so.. but even if there's a yes among you people who read this.. I'll say, ""Screw the men!"" It's not my problem if they couldn't accept the fact that I can't drive!

"Hey, I feel like its been awhile, when in all relativety, my mind is always thinking and it feels like awhile, because things come and go in my head, and by the time, i get to this very ""subject"" of this post, I have been through many other subjects as well.  First off,   to get it off my mind, I just saw the movie ""little black book"" and ending said something like, life happens most, when you are planning for something that is approaching. So stop planning and live your life now. That totally goes against my life, because I have always been the planner, because then I think that I get what I want. But what if I didnt plan, and got what I needed the most, and secretly wanted the most too. But then if you dont plan at all, you could be a loser who doesnt do anything. Conflicting thoughts. I have always told myself not to plan so much, its just that it comes so naturally to me, to plan for college, plan why someone likes me, plan how i mangage my friends, money...everything. Maybe I will start by unplanning some of those things..and letting them come to me. One small thing at a time. I suppose.   we;ll talk soon. Caitlyn

"Well it started of ok, I did some exercising.  Then I went to the drug store to price the perscription I have been carrying around with me, and had never gotten it filled.  I found out to have it filled it would be 130$.  My god what do they think I am made of, Money? Well anyway, I won't be getting that anytime soon.  Then when I came home Pat made a really good stir fry for supper.  But then Karmen was really cranky tonight and my cat got hit by a car.  The cat's ok though so that was good. I have had such a day of ups and downs. But I am still able to say I had an ok day.  I still don't know how to post pictures on here.  But when I can I will put a picture of my beautiful baby doll.  She is positively gorgeous.  I have a job interview next week and I am really nervous. I don't know how well it will go with no voice, and I get nervous in interviews.  When I get nervous I ramble.  So I have started preparing I have over 200 questions I am going to plan the answers too, I am going to plan the questions I am going to ask them at the end and I am researching the company.  That is all I can do besides remembering to breathe.  I just feel I have to make an extra big impression perferably on the good side, since I don't have much of a voice.  So any advice you can give me for my interview would be great:) I hate interviews.  I can write wicked resumes and a good coverletter, but I suck at the talking to people. They intimidate me, and I can not seem to picture people in their underware no matter how hard I try. I never know what to wear to interviews either.  I always feel like I am under dressed for them.  I don't own a ""business suite"", what I have are dressy clothes but to me they don't scream interview clothes.  Anyway I think I have rambled enough for today.

"And so begins the life of my blog, a true understanding of what it is to be bloggish. Okay, so maybe I made that word up. I thought I would begin my disadvantageous interest in blogging for the first time. I have read many and participated in none. Creating this posting off of pure allurement of the idea has been quite interesting and (hopefully) stays that way. Today I create, and juxtapose the ideas of life and wonderment of a being, which whom, has a slightly higher interest in being more than most. With this, I bid you farewell until next time, for now I have work to do.

"Where to begin?! The beginning would be good but I feel that jumping around keeps you on your toes more...jazz's things up a bit!  You are going to go on a strange trip, so grab a cocktail, sit back and buckle up...you are in for a long strange ride...YE-HAAAA!  First of all I must confess that I am the worst writer in the world, my grammar, punctuation and spelling are atrocious. It doesn't matter that there is spell check on this...it just don't matter! I am hopeless!!!!  I feel very old but I know I really am not. I am only 42, well I will be 43 soon. I am a single female, well not really single. I am in a relationship and have been for almost 6 years. My relationship is with another female who is 3 yrs. younger than me. What is age? Just a number. I don't look my age. I look maybe 5-6 yrs. younger than I am if not more on a really good day! Now my body feels like it is 143, which is a shame and that's a novel in itself.  I feel like I am such a failure and a disappointment to my mom, my partner and myself. I have some sisters, 3 to be exact but it don't really matter, they aren't much better. I think of them as 3 peas in a pod all fighting for lead pea! I don't care what they think about me or my life style. I think I am disappointed in life myself...Is this it? Is this all I get? Well if it is I want a refund or I would even settle on an exchange! I know it isn't really fair to say ""IS THIS ALL I GET"" It is the cards I have been dealt, its no ones fault that I haven't done something with myself and my life, not anyones fault but my own. Have I been lazy? I think so. I also think some of it has to do with no encouragement in my younger years. I was really good at the artsy stuff in school. As a matter of fact the art classes are the only classes that I did good in and actually got a's...A+'S at that. As for all the other classes I was lucky to get D's. I had no interest in anything other than art when I was younger. Had I had encouragement who knows where I might be right now instead of here. But no matter what, how I have turned out, how my life is right now is my doing and no one else's. I could have pushed myself to go to school, to make better job choices and to do a bunch of things differently. I guess I blame myself. I have to.  Alrighty, this is it for now, tune in another time for more!

"Which I already knew, of course, but I am feeling pretty sorry for myself. Three and a half weeks ago I tore ligaments in my left knee, effectively curtailing most fun for the next several months. PMO!!! Anyway - the good news is that the bruising has now faded, the swelling is down, I can walk further than I could even a couple days ago. The bad news is that I am still wearing this silly brace and using a cane. The physiotherapist said I ""did a real number"" on my LCL and illotibial band (sp?) and can expect the healing process to take a while. It could have been worse right? I could have broken my leg or completely torn the LCL. It could have been my right leg and I wouldn't be able to drive.   So much for paddling this summer. At this point I still can't bend my knee far enough to get or out of a boat. I CAN still do weights though and I had a short somewhat successful trial on my indoor bike a couple days ago. I walked around the bloack today too - not exactly the 10km run I wished I was doing, but a few days ago I could only make it halfway around and today the whole loop was easy. Progress, progress.  My plan for tomorrow is to get up and ride my bike (indoors again) after I do my physio exercises.

"It's Monday once again, after a short break over the weekend,its funny how time flies nowadays and how you can never get things done, no matter how much effort or planning you've put into them. August is one month that I feel-the days and nights went by in a flash...  Was in the car, on the way to work earlier and there was this one Kancil, which was following me so close from behind. The unbelieavable thing is that, I was doing 140 and so how much was the chap doing? By the look on his face and the passenger sitting right next to him, I could tell that he's a student, studying in the college somewhere near my office or maybe he's a working guy. But they looked young and were pretty excited-being able to hog me like that. I gave way and they went so fast that, for a few moments there, I was praying that their tyre would go *FLAT*!!! ...because they were not worried at all about their safety. Do they know that it's Kancil they're driving, not a bloody Mercedes and even if it is a Mercedes, it's dangerous still for a 17 year old kiddie to drive in such a way. I am not old but I'm not a teenager anymore, I have been there and done that...BUT...I didn't interfere with anybody's life during that time and I did it, with full consideration in mind that, I would bear all the consequences,alone. On my own, of course parents are parents and they'd always worry about things, that you can't stop them. It's a natural instinct embedded in parents, a speacial gift from god. If not,Moms would be walking around leaving their kids and home and shop at Malls...'Why bother about Baby Cemara? No , she'll be fine, she can drink her milk from the bottle by herself.She can suckle later..' We all don't what that, trust me. So, kids or teenagers like those I came across this morning, they're not really bad..they're just at that age where, they rule everything...Hope one of them will turn out to be a successful someone, if not all....  Got to work on something, will continue later.

"I cant figure out why some people only give out their opinions only to destroy someone else. What is wrong with people today? I'm sick and tired of hearing views and beliefs on politics, religion, and other stuff. I'm sick of seeing the way people behave when it comes to opposing views. Why can't we just...I don't know...Sit and enjoy the fresh air on a spring day? Sounds corny I know, but isn't that better than bashing a man for what he thinks is right or wrong. What did Jesus do? He ate with people that were wrong and people who reveled in their own beliefs.  He loved them, he didn't care! I'm so sick of us so called Christians seeking out only people who disagree with us only to prove that we are right! What worth is that? Will the glory of the coming Lord be enough for them and us? I guess not because all we care about is making sure that we are right and that they are wrong. Why can't we enjoy life, loving people, enjoying that we are different and loving them to Christ, not proving it to them. Life is so short. How can we make it count if we don't live by example and live with him? When I go out in the world I will try hard not to condemn people but love them, and in the meantime...Sit and enjoy the day, instead of sinking in my own so-called ""righteousness"". God did not create man to argue...But to love, and prosper with him. And...By the way...If you are going to talk with people who don't agree with you, remember this, ""the greatest single cause of atheism in the world today...Is Christians...Who acknowledge him with their lips and walk out the door and lead on with their lifestyle. That is what I'm believing the world simply finds unbelievable.""

So we all (a group of people...I guess as opposed to dogs, cats, aliens, or rubber duckies) decided we wanted to take a walk along the canal. However, the weather decided it was going to rain at the same time. Now, rain would usually stop a sane person from taking a walk outside, but no...no one ever said we were sane. So we walked...in the rain and lightning and thunder...with umbrellas held high...all in the name of fun (and, oh yeah...exercise).  My official battle cry was, ""It's just water.""  Hmm...it's a shame we don't go out and play in the rain more.

"Woohoo! My Very First Blog. I'm so happy. Now I'm gonna' spill my heart out like a naive little 3 year old! Or something like that.  So Today was the last actual day of school. I'm so happy, now we've got finals to do. What fun. I've got Japanese and Computer Literacy. We did nothing at school today whatsoever. It was really retarded, but it was fun, cause the teachers were somewhat intimidated and forked over tons of candy in a last ditch to maintain some semblance to order.  It worked.  During Science, M*rr*s (take that Google!) was a meanyhead, making me take the darn remote and fast forward through commercials, then count field trip money, then do this, and that, and so forth. Me no like M*rr*s. Oh well. SHE'S GONE FOREVER FROM MY LIFE AFTER THIS. I'm so freakin' happy.  History was kinda' stupid, but Micah and I chased each other around, and Ms. Yi got pissed. Japanese was kool, cause Austin and I got to sumo wrestle or something like it. Everyone was goofing off. It was awesome.  CS, I was locked in a room with Sm*th for a whole period. I was scared. He's still pissed at me, I think. Here's where background is required. He was dissing Mozilla (!), and how they were heralding ThunderBird as the next generation of email thing. Then he proceeds to diss all of Mozilla, including Composer and FireFox. Then, the final straw, he calls ThunderBird FireBird. So I tell him he's wrong and tell him that FireBird was the 1st generation of the  FireFox browser. He just kinda' stares at me. So I'm not sure whether he was really, really pissed or amazed that someone as computer illiterate as me would know that.  Skipping all other classes, I get to English with B*l*sta, 8th Period. I tried to behave in class, and this is the 4th day of the year that I managed to actually pay attention!!! But I got this pencil, and wrote on my binder, ""Blinder than a Mother-Freakin' Doorknob"" with an arrow pointing to my right.   Ms. B*l&sta walks over and has her back to me. She gives a really long, like  5 minute lecture with me holding this next to her. It was picture perfect, and Micah nerly died laughing. No kidding.  At home, I IM'd and got in fights w/ my parents. Nothing else                                         Lotsa' Love (or something like that)

I once got yelled at for being 4 minutes late to work... I come from a different world than this.   My older boss' at the same company didn't know what ""late"" meant unless it was for a meeting.  I work on the road a lot, and there it's do your work till you are done, like my 24 hour day of work the other week.  Where my old boss' knew this and considered it fine to do what we like when we are in the office (I used to get in between 9 and noon, and leave between 1 and 5... sometimes being from noon to 1pm).  Now I get ripped from that into a 9am start time... and here is the kicker... I still have to work till my work is done so it's not 9 to 5... it's 9 till done as long as done comes at 6 or after.  I don't understand this frame of thinking.  I need some flexibility in my time when i'm at work in the office considering I have long hours every time i'm on the road, I don't think it's too much to ask for... but the boss says no.  Well i'm rambling a lot... basically I was pretty damn late today and even though I was doing work from home my boss still had a ""talk"" with me about alarm clocks and asked me if I was doing smack last night and the such.  Luckily he can't get rid of me right now because i'm too valuable an asset.  Who thinks I should just f with him and come in late all the time to see if I can cross the line?

"It is weekends like this, that make Seattle a great place to be.  Spending alot of time out on my back deck (temps in the 80's).  Spent yesterday afternoon organizing the neighborhood water gun fight.  It seems that over the last few summers I have aquired a small arsenal of super soakers, and squirt guns, so am able to arm most all of the neighborhood kids.  Really have to get a digital camera in the budget so I can post pic's.  It was not all play yesterday, as I was doing some side work (home networking).  This is the part of the post that could actually be useful for someone reading it.  Although most everyone I know that would read this is a techie.  Here it is, the three simple things to do, to keep your computer and/or computers and home network running smooth.  1.  KEEP those Anti-virus definitions updated and current.  You can actually schedule it to do it without any user intervention.  We would also like to ask all virus writers to please not spoof the email address of the dumbass who opened the virus in the first place.  We would really like to know who this person is.  2.  Run those Microsoft Critical updates, or get a MAC.  3.  Spyware is slowing down alot of the computers that I work on.  Download and run Adaware, its free.  I personnally recommend SpySweeper it tends to be a little more proactive.  There it is my feeble attempt to help people and computer relations.

I've decided to not drive for a while and get my shit straight, take a class.  I'm also pissed off because now I can't go see Dashboard Confessional in Duluth, GA on the 19th.  Oh well, we all know that God works in mysterious and often weird ways.  Maybe I'll learn something valueable in my class....or a girl...that would be nice.  A girl that can't drive like me.  The girl I hit was kinda hot...so I was trying to like ""comfort"" her...haha.  Oh yeah, another shitty detail was that she was the police's daughter...there should be a law against that.  Yes...Law enforcement personel's kids should not be allowed to drive.  Oh who am I kidding...I just fucked up....again.  I'll take it like a man and get another job.  Wreck + Wreck = More Jobs!

"I've been missing Nealy a lot lately. I dont want her back. I just crave her friendship, laugh, and maybe the way she holds me. I know I can find that with someone else.  I found this this morning: My heart belongs to my soulmate, and she knows who she is, and for today we are apart, but time will tell, so I wait.. Peace and prayers always. Serenity is not freedom from the storm, but peace within the storm. Sometimes we must let go of the ones we love, so we can love ourself, them, and others more

"Well I spent time with some of my many friends.  The people I hang out with most are Richard, Matt, and Zach.  Well they were over today, so we decided to go to the mall.  I LOVE music video games.  And I had been looking for a PS2 game called ""Rez"" for awhile.  Well, I found it today.  I found Rez at the mall media store called FYE.  It was $31.99 but it was well worth it, since it's an awesome and very rare game.  I also purchased a CD at FYE.  It's ""The Best of, The Church"".  I love the band, The Church, and this CD is great.  It has 17 songs on it, and I love all of them.  After the mall, we all came back to my house and played video games/watched funny things on the internet/listened to music.  I love spending time with my friends.

"I feel like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz!  Except that instead of a tornado, the State Department has come to disrupt my life.    My background:My mother was an OMS for many years and retired in 2002. I never lived with her overseas but the kids and I did get to visit Addis, Dhahran, Riyadh, Barbados. She was always after me to take the FSWE so I did twice in the early 90's.  I didn't pass either time so I thought it wasn't meant to be. I became the teacher I always dreamed of being.   Well, life changes.  My oldest son was in college and after 9/11, he decided he wanted to make a difference and following grandma's lead, he wanted to join the FS.  He wanted me to take the FSWE with him for moral support.  Guess who passed?  Me.  I went to orals the first time in Nov and only scored a 5.1.  My son and I, along with another son had already signed up to take the FSWE again.  Guess who passed this time?  Me, again.  This time I did orals in July and received a 5.9.  Took forever to get my clearances through but then I made the register.  I was offered the June A-100 class but had the last class of my master's to finish so I declined. They then offered me September.    Did I really want to do this?  That has been the million dollar question! Or in the case of the FS, maybe the hundred dollar question. Do I want to leave my kids, have my husband leave his career, just to try something I may not like?  I have gone forward and taken all the steps but I still have days of doubt.  I have my first grandbaby coming on July 22.  How will I like leaving her?  My other son graduates from college in May, will I be here for it?  Another son is getting married in the spring.  How could I miss that?  No guarantees I will still be in the states.  What if I don't like being gone from everyone?  What if I miss teaching? What if I can't stand working in a visa mill?  Is everyone else in the 121st having these doubts?  I sent in all my paperwork on Friday.  I guess that makes it official. Time to get back to sorting 10 years of accumulated junk. At least my house is getting clean!

"My Retirement  So now these are my retirement years No easy chair for me So many places I want to go So many places to see. For oh so long I was your friend, a colleague and now a new wife But now I am at a new beginning Starting a brand new life. That pile of knitting that patiently waited For me to take some time I might get back to you in a day Or put you back in line. Those cookbooks that pile higher and higher I hear their pleading call Beckoning for me to come and see them Before I see next fall. The vacations I will sit and plan Exotic places afar Traveling by train or bus Or even  in my trusty car. The whole world waits for me to start To claim it as its own The excitement overwhelms me at times From me I am sure this is shown. I won’t forget the things I learned The people I have met Nor forget that first moment I will get my retirement check. No more alarms to waken me From my comfy rest I am retired now you see This new life is the best. Oh Retirement, sweet Retirement I sing with joy and praise The only damper to my joy I will miss my yearly raise!!!!!

"I've been having trouble sleeping.  Well, not really.  I can sleep allright but I have these Godawful dreams that wake me up.  They aren't even the scary kind that are at least interesting to think about the next day. Like ""What the hell did I eat last night that made me dream about long legged owls wearing blue jeans chasing me through my 1st grade classroom while screaming shutup"" No, I've been dreaming about work.  Usually, I have a row of figures from one construction bid and I'm trying to compare them to a 2nd bid.  How freaking boring is that!  But it creates a really restless sleep.  Then at 4AM, I am wide awake.  I feel so AWAKE!  More awake then I've ever felt in my entire life.  I could read a book on the ""Philosophy of Physics"" and still be wide awake.  I know because I tried.  Then at about 5am I drift off to sleep only to be awakened 2 hours later by the alarm.  I awaken feeling so groggy, almost hung over like.  And now it is 11am and I am so tired.  I ...just ....want ....to ....take ....a ...nap.

Or, like my best friend, Jimmy, too busy with his girlfriend to talk to me... Not to mention that I've been working alot lately.

"Yesterday while shooping for my husband, i am usually very nice and polite and try to use as much German as possible. But I always don't have the write words or i just don't know the language that well to come up with a solution to my conversation. Anyway I went to this store here called,""Budnikowsky"". It is smaller to our Rite Aides or Drug stores in the States. The only difference is they don't carry drugs. On the Apotheke pharmacys carry any such over the counter remedy's. My daughter had dropped her binki or pacifier while we were walking and so i had to get a replacement for her and the best to go for that was Budni. Kowing that they carried such items. After getting my stroller in the store and wading threw all the people i had found what i was looking for. I then heading for the line to check out. Since the store is crowed most of the time,even on Mondays, I had to push my way to get in line or other people would just get in front of you again with the no personal boudries issue. If you leave room for another person someone will think that it is meant for them and just cut in front of you no second thought. Well as i approached the counter of this young cashier, she of course never sported a smile to customers but instead basically looked up briefly and gave the look of NEXT! My turn! I said Hi! and she said Guten Tag, meaning Hello back. My total was 1,98 euros. I gave her 2. She then in turn was asking if i had any change but because I dont speak the language i didnt understand what she was saying to me. What kinda of change would she need for 1,98? Two was good enough. All she had to do was give me back two cents. But because i didnt understand what she was saying i did understand her body language which ended up in a huff and a puff from her. Like she was telling me you stupid idiot dont you understand and if you dont you dont belong in my line. Well of course after that gester and after dealing with my sick daughter all day shopping i had all I could take of the day and promptly recieved my change and replied to her, ""You know yo can eat shit!!"". From the look on her face i can tell she understood everything i said even in english. After that i felt great for the rest of the day. I find if you are nice to these workers they run all over you until you are nasty like them back and then they are your best friend.  Viki C.

"My first post in this new journal that I've opened and am right now trying to think of something interesting to write. My name is not Catelina, but I've had friends think that it was, because I get referred to it very often. My sister calls me Catelina Marguerita, and once when I told a friend that and I commented that I was an alcoholic drink, they said ""delicious"". It gains some strange, perhaps unusual responses.  I am at university at the moment, studying a bachelor of science and am presently contemplating where it will take me. In no way, whatsoever, do I want to be a Scientist or a teacher. I am enamoured with the idea of becoming a doctor, and believe that the glasses which I got a week ago will aid me in my quest to take up this occupation. Yes, I do believe glasses make you smarter; it's a nice way to look at things, isn't it? But, seven years is an awful long wait to take up when you're craving in the most facist sense to be away from the world of studying.  I saw a pile of Medical lecture notes on sale at the university book store for $1.45, and was so utterly tempted to pick one up, pay for it, and go and sit in on the lectures. Then, when I finally get there, I will know most of the content and will breeze through the course... perhaps.  I have lived in the same house for all eighteen years of my life and my parents have been married for over 30 years, which in this day and age, is an achievement in itself, seeing as so many of my friend's parents are divorced, separated or estranged. I have a friend, who has moved so often in her life and craves to leave the place where she lives right now and for a time in our past, was so angry at me, I have come to realise, that I didn't want to go with her. But what people don't seem to understand is that living in the same house for so long, with parents who still love each other and siblings who are not on anti-depressents, is a remarkable, albeit maybe boring, life. I cannot think of a place I would rather be, even if I have only been on a plane once in my life and that was six months ago.

"It was a cold kind of day. The kind of cold kind of day that makes you chilly if you happen to be out side without warm clothes on. That is how cold it was. And, it just so happens that a character in this story happened to be out side on this cold day without any warm clothes on. In fact, he was not wearing any clothes at all. For that reason, and other reasons too, it was imperative that he find shelter immediately. Or soon there after. He had never experienced a day like this before. Ever before. Never in his lifetime before. He hopes to never experience anything like this again. but is what he hopes for really what is best for him? Only time will tell. This is the story of a man. Of a boy. Of a legend that no has heard of. Of a hero that no one knows. It will make you laugh. It will make you cry. You will read it from start to finish. You will not be able to put it down. You just wait. You will think you are just reading a book. You should know better. You will soon realize, the book is reading you.  He was running through the snow like a blind man. All he could see was white. Endless white. Everywhere he turned. Everywhere he fell. No matter where he looked. All there was, was white. The poor boy. He went flying as he tripped over a particularly bumpy patch of white. Over the cliff he went. Into the void. He fell for what seemed like only seconds, but really days passed as he fell. What could he do though, besides fall? Well really quite a lot, but how was he to know? If he had read the instructional manual before he took the plunge he would have known that in order to stop falling, all he had to do was simply to stop.

"Well, I bought my plane ticket back to Flint yesterday. It's going to be nice to see my family again. Of course, as soon as I had my ticket I talked to my sister and learned that home sweet home has become more disturbing than ever. It's hard for Flint to shock me--we're talking about a city that considered selling the trees in its parks for lumber, but I'm actually starting to get scared. A friend's cousin was beaten to death in his car in front of his eight-year-old son. One of the editors at the magazine my sister writes her vegan cooking column for was beaten to near-death and left in the street. Oh, and two women were found dead, one downtown and the other near Mott Park. Mott Park for God's sake! My favorite neighborhood in Flint. Where I always wanted to live. Where I went to school. Where my sister and brother-in-law just bought a house. I always look forward to going home, but this time I'm getting an ominous, horror-movie feeling. I'm learning to appreciate Mankato more and more. I think I'll just stay in Flint long enough to see  Hamlet  (which I'm sure will be excellent) and then I'll head to the Saint Clair River Delta, relax on the island and watch the freighters float by. Oh and play with as many dogs as possible before I come back to No-pets-in-every-lease-ville, U.S.A.

The story goes: I had been begging her to go out with me, she finally agreed to go out with me. I was so happy, and as it turns out i was her first kiss. It was great. She is the greatest thing to happen to me in a while. She is beautiful and i don't think she believes it. But she is. She has surprised me so much since i have known her. When i first met her my thought was ""Man she is beautiful"" I also thought ""I am going to get her if its the last thing i do"". I knew i had to have her. And now we are going out and her mom doesn't know! Not that we think she would get mad though i am sure she would, but we want to give it time. I want to be able to stay there a few times before i am not allowed to. I am sure that it might backfire at us but its a danger i am willing to conquer when it comes. Well its been 4 days since i asked her out, and i think it is going great. I got to spend time with her while i was there, and we had quite a bit of fun. But that is our business. She really did surprise me. She really is a great kisser, she can always get me going. I haven't told her that, but everytime she kisses me, i get a hard on. I guess she will know now!

We drove the gator and got really muddy. we then jumped on the trampoline. That was kinda cool. Then we took him home. I went to kohls then and then went to sams. I went home and slept for a while, then rode the gator, and got really muddy.. I then tooka shower and got ready to go out. Then I went and saw Shrek 2. It was really funny.

They had the kind of friendship that i always dream of but their friendship is being tested again and i think it is reaili bad this time. I hope here that they will get though this too as it wasn't easy to find friends that thinks alike.

"Alright... I just browsed through a ton of blogs. I'm procrastinating working on my thesis... but it's so damn boring! Anyway, people put the stupidest stuff on their blogs! If you want random people to read about your life, don't post 2-word inside jokes... Blogs should be about your life... Or at least something worthwhile. Saying a bunch of random quick words that only your friends understand should be saved for your damn IM away messages. Your mindless blogs are getting in the way of people seeing mine! And mine aren't worthless. Mine are cool. They're not about ""I went to the store and bought some flip-flops"" but about crazy weird stories that happen to me at the mental hospital or about how I visited Bob Jones University 6 times in high school or about how I had to wear skirts below the middle of my knees to school before they came into style or about how I got kicked out of my Christian high school for having cigarettes in my car (I wasn't even smoking them!) or about how after this happened, I tried to commit suicide (that was long ago, I'm doing fine now, but thanks for asking) and while I was in the hospital being injected with crazy stuff that would make me crap and vomit until I could hardly breathe or swallow my God-fearing, compassionate high school principal was telling my parents how I was expelled. Well, at any rate... I won't bore you with worthless inside jokes. Hell, if you bother to read my blog, you'll be the better for it... you know why? Cuz I've got alot of really weird stories.

"So I have to be in this wedding in September.  I am trying to convince my friend Peter M to escort me to this wedding, but so far he will not commit to it.  My Hubby is going to be out of town on a camping trip so I am going to have to go solo if Peter doesn't go.  It is a Bolivian/Irish wedding.  The bride is about 5'2"" and the groom is about 6'4"", plus the groom looks about as Irish as Irish can get complete with red hair and freckles and the Bride looks truly Bolivian.  They are quite an interesting couple to see.   So the problem is that the only people I will know at the entire wedding are the bride, groom and bride's mother.  Most of the people on the bride's side are from Bolivia and speak very little English.  I know that this sounds like a very fun event, but if Peter M was the good friend that he says he is he would come and escort me ; )  Oh, here is the interesting thing:  The groom has multiple piercings.  Including his penis and testicles.  I am all okay with the piercing thing and everything, but I can't help but thinking the ding-a-ling piercing has got to hurt.  Oh and he did them all himself.  I asked the bride to be if urine and other bodily fluids leak out the other holes and she confirmed that they did.  Dude, that means his dick is like a freaking colander!  That is a bit strange to me.  I would be afraid to have sex with him (not that I would want to anyway), for fear that some parts of his penis rings would come off inside of me and then have to be located.  Okay that would be just TOO CREEPY!  Okay enough rambling about nothing, anyway my daughter is crying and my husband is ignoring her.

I first tried to blog with a different blogger site, and To Tell You The Truth, I didn't like the feel.  Oh, it was simple enough, if awkward, but the 'home' page of the blogging site was so darn busy I felt lost there.     This place is so much better. I should have gone with what I knew was a tried and true service.  Anyways, this is my dumping ground.  Stuff I find on the internet that I must squawk about (good and bad), late night frustrations and nightmares, and the occasional proud parenting moment (or self flaggellation over same)-- all will be posted here so I can embarrass my family and bore strangers.

"These are just a few of the poems that I have written in my past.  Granted, they ain't the greatest, but in my eyes, they are also not the worst.  I hope if who ever does read these, enjoys them.     This first one I truely like.  Carpe Noctem By C. Kevin McBroom  Spinning yarns and  Spinning tales Of creatures of the night And of banshee wails  They say monsters do not exist Or at least so it seems Tell that to a small boys cries Or a little girls screams  As a clawed paw falls Quietly with each step Behind its opaque eyes  Many secrets are kept  The small creature stalks The night of the moon With nie a sound With a smell of doom  A light through a window Spurs the small beast on Moving swift ever silent For inside is food to feast on  A light scratch at the window Followed by a stifled cry ‘Tis only a small kitten Wanting in from the cold outside  True Thoughts By C. Kevin McBroom  I’m tired of peoples attitudes Treating me as if I am in their servitude People just don’t understand Just because I’m not Exactly as they have planned I feel as though I’m looked down on Try as hard as I might Even when I win, I haven’t won Sometimes I want to Open that final dark door If I do, would I finally win?  Friends fall wayside, as do lovers Once again I am all alone Walking solemnly through the clover Pictures race through my mind I try not to look, is it Because I’m afraid of what I’ll find? I’m better off left alone and silent No one to worry or care about No one for my heart to be sent Tears fall but I laugh in spite I close my eyes to hide myself And finally give up the fight      Personally I've always thought that one was kind of depressing, all suicidal and stuff, but for some odd reason, I still like it.  Seasons By C. Kevin McBroom  In the sleepy summer sunset  I remember your bright eyes Reassuring and softly staring Reflective of the clearest blue skies  During the wild winter winds As the snow covered the ground We walked hand in hand At night you chased away the cold dark shroud  In sun-filled spring days Your lovely laughter filled the air As we rolled in and over the clover Life was without a single care  In the sleepy summer sunsets I remember your bright eyes       I wrote that last one for my now wife.  I know it is sort of corny and hallmark-ish,(Is that a word?), but I like the picture it brings to mind and it is probably the least syrupy poem that I wrote to her.

"So, I swear I meet someone everyday that is so profound, I dont think that I ever have the thoughts to equate to their greatness. I met this guy once who changed my life in 2 days of subbing for one of my classes. A free-lance actor, better yet, a free-lance thinker. I can see why people say that when you meet the right person you could run away with them and nothing would ever matter.  In the book Catch 22, they talk about running away. And they debate, that running away is bad, because your problems will eventually come back to haunt you, and the conclusion was that he wasnt running away, he was running to his problems, rather making his life more interesting with every second that he spends.  Sometimes, with all of my set ""life-plans"" I want to not forget, that I cant live in--what will happen in the future, but rather in this moment. I never want to be the girl who is uncontent with this moment, because I cant wait for the next moment.  Could that free-lance thinker help me run away. All i know is that, when I want a serious relationship and even think about marriage, I want to meet someone exactly like him. Who I can ""run away"" with, to solve my problems head on, and live in this moment.

"I used to eat strawberry chapstick when I was a kid. When I say eat, I'm talking roll up the tube and take bites of it. I also used to have tragically chapped lips. I would always ask my dad for a new tube when we were in the checkout line of the grocery store and he kept buying them until he realized that no human can go through chapstick that quickly if you use it in the conventional way. Perhaps the fact that my lips could have been used as an alternative to sand paper gave it away and he soon found out about my snacking habits and refused to buy me anymore chapstick.  Now many years later, I have a slight obsession with chapstick and other lip products and if I may say so myself, I also have wonderfully soft lips. But, I have recently concluded that the ingestion of strawberry chapstick has lead to my many neuroses (we'll get into them a little later). I suppose they could have come from my parents divorce, my mom's abusive remarriage, the teasing I endured at school, some chemical imbalance or maybe even the time I crashed my tricycle and whacked my head on the concrete, but I've decided I like blaming it on chapstick instead.  It wasnt until a few years ago that I realized I really did have some strange neuroses and that most other people have very few or even none. In the last few months, I've noticed that they effect me more that I ever thought. I used to think ""oh thats just a quirk about me"" or ""hey, everyone is a little crazy about some things"".  I am not a lunatic by any means and most of my ""quirks"" are internal and really only effect me, but because I know I was not ALWAYS this way, it has really lead me to wonder *When does a person become who they are going to be and when is it too late to go back?*  Of course you can get some therapy or take some medication to rid you of many issues you may have, but after you have grown and matured enough to even realize you have issues then wouldnt any kind of ""intervention"" change WHO YOU are or force you to go through live pretending that you are someone else after you have been ""cured""? Is a ""cure"" really just self-denial about who you really are? Do you really want to do that?

"This is my first attempt at keeping any sort of journal. I have never been very good at keeping any sort of record of my life. I have always had the fear that once an experience is put on paper, the brain no longer has a need to remember it and the memory is thus discarded, or rerouted for use in another way. Therefore, I am rather skeptical to put much of note down here too soon. Perhaps my mind ramblings will be just that, ramblings, nothing more, nothing less. Or, perhaps, I will learn that the more I jot down, the more I will be able to remember. The brain never ceases to amaze me. It remembers things long since forgotten, in a way...Perhaps that is where DeJaVue comes from. I am constantly in a state of rememberance, that is the way that I know I am on the right track in life. Whenever I don't get a memory of something that I am doing that I know I have never done before, I know that what I am doing is that which I am supossed to be doing. My life, otherwise, might get very complicated and then where would I be?  A friend from my childhood has had a very trying life and started blogging to sort things out. I am very proud of her for that. She is who made me decide to try it. I don't really have an outlet for my life, my husband has a hard time understanding my need for higher and higher education. That is not to say that he is not supportive or encouraging by any means, it is just that he felt a Bachelors degree was all that was really needed. I, on the other hand, feel that I need to get more. I am in the process of completing my BA in Molecular Biology and a minor in Chemistry, only to persue a DVM/PhD combo in the next 6yrs.  Perhaps I will obtain that goal, but for now I am just looking forward to finally obtaining my first degree...and it has only me since 1996...3 years sabatical for work and my son...etc, basically life in general... Well, that is it for my first blog, perhaps next time it will be more insightful.

"I think I first heard about ""blogs"" about a year ago. I'm sure at the time I swore I'd never have one, now here I am. A suggestion from a good friend and I steped right up...me and myself might have something to say about what ""I"" have done.   A year ago things were simpler. I had no idea what I was in store for. Getting laid-off, going back to school, losing people I never thought I'd see walk away. On the other hand I guess I didn't think I'd get to see my parents again for the first time in 5 years. I probably have more mixed feelings about that than anything...but I'll save that for another post...  So here I am. Somehow the world feels smaller every year. I feel like the boundaries society places on our minds through work and school has shrunk my mind and locked it up...I didn't feel this way a year ago...as if every year this world pushes us all one step closer to accepting the bull shit as normal...

I feel so lost and tangled. I feel as though I need to become a person of my own do what i like and not just do whatever everyone else tells me to do. I also need to become a more confident person every step or decision i make in my life i feel as though something wrong may happen i need to mature and be myself. The other day i was speaking to my brother-in-law and i was just talking to him and telling him how ive wanted to do accounting my whole life and he said that i was not capable of doing so ofcoarse he was joking because he laughed later...but that made me think that some people think of me as if i am immature i dont know how to prove to everyone that im not that little girl anymore. i am the youngest out of 5 girls. In a way i am very happy and thankful of allah that i have 4 sisters a mom dad and 3 brother-in-laws who look out for me. but sometimes i feel as though i need a little privacy i dont always want someone to be there watching every step i take i need to learn from my experiences and in order to experience i need a little space. which i feel as though im not getting. im not sick of anyone i love my family from the bottom of my heart and i want them to be there for me all the time and i am there for them 100% whenever they need me, no doubt, but now a days i just want to go out and experience the world. When i say experience the world i mean i wanna be able to hang out with my friends more often not only in school but out of school. i wanna be able to go to Florida to my sisters place by myself without my sister bushra being with me. i want my parents to see that im not a little baby anymore. but because i have rules that i have to fallow i cant do all of this. anyway thats enough for now im so tired right now im gonna go to bed....peace out!

You know how much time jts wasted trying to fix this problem. The whole time I was thinking only if I have my own computers. While I am mad at these computer something horrorable was happening out side the camp. 20 mile south of here is the town of Najaf. Those crazy people was acting up all week, threaten to blow up oil line and stuff. So the US marine when down their and kill 300 militia. They got us here alerted of possible counter attack. The trouble they case us just made me want to go down their to joint the fight. I just hate wearing body armor to walk around the camp.

"Anyone who hates barbie will love love love this site!  Here is a song me and my friend made up to make fun of Barbie:  I’m a Barbie girl in the Barbie world. My hair is really real but my feet are just an ugly deal. I’m really, really skinny but im not really worth money. Some people think im worth the deal and some think im a rip-off for real. My clothes are cool but don’t go with me they just look good on my scene. Ohhh I’m a Barbie girl in the Barbie world I’m really fantastic and made of all plastic.  I have friends but my friends have better trends. I have a pet possum and he’s so awesome. I am really, really weak and such a freak. I have lots of wrinkles and my hair is always crinkled. I can bark like a dog but it sounds like a frog. My hair is very rare because it has an ugly glare. I work for the news and everyone hates my shoes. I like hi heels but when I walk I look like an eel. I like to eat bugs because they rhyme with rugs. People say I talk too much and that’s why the give me a little punch and people say I munch to much when I eat my nasty lunch. I’m a Barbie girl in the Barbie world I’m made of plastic its really fantastic. I have big ears and they give me lots of tears. I look really dinky just like a slinky. I’m not a kitty because im not pretty. I look like porky the pig and I know how to dig. I have so much pettiness because I’m so hideous when I got married I married something hairy that looked like my pet Gary. My very yellow hair looks like an ugly bear. Once I met the dairy fairy and she gave me my pet Gary. I’m a Barbie girl in the Barbie world I’m made of plastic it’s so fantastic. Some people say I look like a mouse and live in a tiny house. On Christmas day my mommy made me take an x-ray to see if I ate a stingray. Yesterday I got so cold that I turned into mold and that’s why this is all I have to say.  Ohhh I’m a Barbie girl in the Barbie world I’m made of plastic it’s so fantastic. Ohh I’m a Barbie girl in the Barbie world.   Barbie hater

"Kevin got an email from the sportswear place asking his salary range.  Although unscrupulous, I intercepted this email via webmail and replied with a 25k-30k requirement, citing that the last job held paid 28k with benefits.  After sending this email, I let it remain in the inbox to be downloaded to his outlook.  As predicted, he saw the email and wanted to respond to it with a 25-30k requirement.  I am good.  So while he was indisposed in the shitter, I made a dummy email that said the same thing and sent it to a dummy email addy.  It was bounced back undeliverable, but I deleted it from the inbox and deleted mail box so he'll never know the difference.  When he came back in from the bathroom, he read the sent copy and was satisfied with the reply.  Not that he should actually send his own stuff.  I made the resume.  I wrote the cover letter.  I found the job.  I applied him for it.  Then he has the audacity to tell me he has to do everything because I ask him to bring me something from the kitchen while he is up and already in the kitchen.  Hmmmm.  He better get this friggin job because I'll be god damned if I have to sell my car so we can get by and I have to drive a junk piece of shit even though I make a ton of money.  Sad, but true, I have to pay for every bill, plus my debt, rent, car payment, vacation fund (which I made a separate one for me) pet costs, food, EVERYTHING.  He even asked if I could use my credit card to buy him toys.  What?  I don't think so asshole.  If I have to do without some things I like, so do you.  I'm contemplating giving up my car, that I worked hard for, but you want to go on buying fucking toys?!  Not going to happen!

I hate public school, alot of teachers just dont care about their students.

"this title is more of what i am looking for than what i am offering. i was looking for a way to start some good conversations on this topic but was unsure as to where i should go to do so....until now. so, that is what i am wondering. personally, i think that for the most part, the church has missed the point over the last 500 years or so but this has become more evident in recent years, as illustrated by this excerpt from ""Blue Like Jazz"":       ""In a recent radio interview I was sternly asked by the host, who did not consider himself a Christian, to defend Christianity. I told him that I couldn’t do it, and moreover, that I didn’t want to do defend the term. He asked me if I was a Christian and I told him yes. “Then why don’t you want to defend Christianity?” he asked, confused. I told him I no longer knew what the term meant. Of the hundreds of thousands of people listening to his show that day, some of them had terrible experiences with Christianity, they may have been yelled at by a teacher in a Christian school, abused by a minister, or browbeaten by a Christian parent. To them, the term Christianity meant something that no Christian I know would defend. By fortifying the term, I am only making them more and more angry. I won’t do it. Stop ten people on the street and ask them what they think of when they hear the word Christianity and they will give you ten different answers. How can I defend a term that means ten different things to ten different people? I told the radio show host that I would rather talk about Jesus and how I came to believe that Jesus exists and that he likes me. The host looked back at me with tears in his eyes. When we were done, he asked me if we could go get lunch together. He told me how much he didn’t like Christianity but how he had always wanted to believe Jesus was the son of God.""    i am not saying that i disagree with the teaching of Jesus nor with that of the Bible but rather with the fundamental ring-wing Christianity of the 20th century. what are your thoughts on christian spirituality?

"I still have two weeks of the Associates in Internal Medicine, LTD left but I can feel my nerves tingling. Even Though it will be a full time job I really have no choice other than to view it as an endless learning experience. Which is is how I should really view everything. I will spend this time in anticipation and preparedness.     Since this is the first open-ended full time job based entirely on theatre, I see the opportunities for my future knocking. Loud. Slowly, but surely,  I will begin the steps that have seen throughout my life. This journey will only end at my destiny which has continued to become clearer and clearer since the age of 8.  It's truly wonderful to be working side by side with GOD all the way; Even if he only shows up every once in a while. But I have no doubt as to where I'll end up, my only confusion is  how  I'll  end up there. I guess that's the fun of the journey. I guess.     The purpose of this blog will be 3-fold.     First: This will be a way to keep in contact with all my friends and family about information that pertains to my professional life.(Audio Mote will be the personal blog)     Second: This will be a way for me keep track of my learning curve. Excellent records should help expand and retain my knowledge as much as the application of that knowledge. And I hope to expand my exponentially for the rest of my life   Third: This will be an EXCELLENT way for me bolster my memory until I die. I've never been successful at keeping journals, yet I will make a valiant attempt to make this one stick. Constant recalls, admirations, regrets, and forlornings of all my memories will exercise and strengthen every one of them until the end of my days. This shall truly be wonderful tool.     Please feel free to post as many comments as you wish. I need them.  Try not to get bored with my blogs. They don't bore me.  Respect my opinion no matter how much it is conflicts with yours. This can be very hard.  And as always, logic will prevail over the illogical. This blog and my life depend on it.     read on and enjoy        -Dustin Mote  Chicago,IL

"I guess I should start out by telling a little about myself ...  I'm 16 years old, and I live in south florida.   I tend to  live  at the beach. I just don't understand how you can be so blessed as to be able to live on the ocean and not take advantage of it ..  I do things a typical 16 year old does, I guess. I love dancing, drinking, surfing, shopping, tanning, music, movies, and just hanging out. Okay, so I'm from boca raton, and as many of you  may  have heard, girls there tend to be shallow bitches .. I happen to be neither, unless you  really  piss me off ;)  Things that I live for are sunsets, sunrises, first kisses, hockey games..& players*:P, smoothies, FSU football, chocolate covered strawberries, dancing the night away, and gazing at the stars.  I want to be famous. I'm not really sure how I'm going to go about doing this, but hey, if it happens, I'll be thrilled.  I don't take things for granted. I live life day by day, and I try not to worry about what's gonna happen tomorrow. Life is short. I believe in forgiving someone who's hurt you, even if they don't deserve it. Don't judge a book by it's cover. Spend as much time with your family as you can, especially your grandparents. You can learn more than you've ever imagined.  I've never  really  been  in  love, romantically that is. I've loved a lot, but I'm scared. Scared of being hurt, scared of loving someone so much as to not be able to live without them. Lately, I've been finding out that trying so hard  not  to love, hurts just as much.  With one look at me, you'd probably label me as a typical ""dumb"" blonde bimbo. Hopefully, if you really take the time to know me, you'll realize that, even though I do have my ditzy moments, I'm not at all like my exterior shows.  I'm a sexual person. If you don't like it, then don't say anything to me. I'm not at all slutty, but I'm in touch with my sexuality. I believe that as long as you're comfortable with your body and who you are, then that's a perfectly fine thing to be.  I'm probably one of the  most  open people you'll ever meet. So, looking at me, you might not think so, but I am. I've been through a lot, and you'll find all of it out eventually.  Anyways, I guess that's me in a nutshell. I guess I'll be writing a lot more later, so hope to hear from all of you .. peace xo

"Everybody's been arguing today, and it's driving me out of what little bit of my mind that I have left. First of all, my mom wouldn't take me and my boyfriend(T.J.) to the mall. That was only the beginning, though..I'm usually the arguing one of the family, but she's acting like a fleeting psycho today! i don't know or really even care why she's so mad, but she doesn't have to fly off the handle at everyone who crosses her path! It's really bad when she only has 1 or 2 days off a week, and I don't even want to be around her. things just seem so much peaceful when she isn't even here. I don't think that's a good thing, but I know that me and her DON'T get along, and i'm not as upset when she's at work. It really sucks that i wish she actually was at work. It's okay though, I get to go shopping and go to work myself tomorrow, then on Wednesday I get to go to church AND see T.J. I really like him..he's like the ""guy version"" of me..He listens to the same msuic, and likes alot of the same movies, sports, and stuff that I do. I just can't get over all that we have in common. I just hope he isn't mad that my mom hasn't let me call him back..i have to wait until 9 to do that. i don't see why we have to use stupid cell phones. I wish we just had a normal phone, and I wish we were a normal family..If I told my parents that, they'd be like ""well most of the time YOU are the problem""...Real good way to make your kid feel wanted, huh? Anyways, school starts back in a couple of weeks, so between school during the day, working at night, church on wednesdays and sundays, i probably won't be here that much anyway. *Yay* Plus since I'm a senior, I'll probably have alot of senior activities and stuff. Wow. I can't believe I'm going to graduate in june. This is exciting, but I don't know what I'm going to do afterwards..I guess i just need to worry about making it TO my graduation. I wish there was some way to make my parents understand me a little bit better, but I guess there isn't. Well, i don't know what else to say, i just hope i get to talk to T.J. or one of my other close friends, like Elizabeth, tonight...bye...

"I love that word. Ponderings. If you break it up you get pond, like lake, eh, like oh, ring like disaster. Because wedding rings do tend to end up in disaster. So pondering is like dipping into a lake of disaster. Mmmm. Maybe if I shut my eyes I'll be able to feel the waves washing over me, hear the delicate ripples as leaves fall into my pond and breathe in the air of immortality. If the Philosophers Stone is a soluble tablet, my lake of disaster is the solution for it. Like in chemistry. I dreamt the other night that I was in a cold, dark lake and that I was below, watching the world through a rippled mirror. I saw myself peering down and a white hand slooshing the water and slooshing my view. When it was finally clear again, all there was was a star that lit up the lake. And in the middle of the star, there was me, spread out in a crucifix shape with my eyes blazing and my hair fanning out like it does underwater. I reached out to feel the wetness on my hair, but I felt only heat as the star plunged into the icy water and I melted into oblivion. I love random dreams.

I don't know what I will be doing today. I think I might go pay my phone bill, other than that, watch TV  , go online. You can't even go outside because its raining and dark out. Oh well.  Later.

"Hey ... my name's JJ and this is my online diary.  A couple years back, I used to publish this journal on urbanboys.com, which no longer exists.  Basically, I chronicled my ""sexcapades"" and those of my friends.  It was a lot of fun, and it helped me to meet a LOT of great guys ... guys that I will be friends with for life.  But, it was VERY time consuming.  I'm thinking using Blogger will make it much easier, and I've decided to give it another try.  I'll also use this journal to keep you updated on what's going on with my other sites (like  urlLink http://urbanboys.blogspot.com  and  urlLink http://urbanboyoftheweek.blogspot.com ) and how things are going in general with me.  So, not just sex sex sex this time :-)  But, I'm sure there'll be plenty of that, cuz I'm still addicted! (Hahaha)

"I awoke this morning in a foul mood.  Why??  I don't really know.  I had become a little testy on the phone with my girlfriend last night but not enough to justify it carrying over to the next day.  One thing I do know is it is setting the precedence for the rest of the day, which isn't really surprising as once I get in a foul mood it is extremely hard to pull myself up out of the trenches of self loathing and hatred.  I've been at work for the last 4 hours and have thus far accomplished nothing, at least a lot more nothing then what I usually accomplish while at work.  In recent times I have slipped from a model employee to the try to do as little as possible disgruntle employee, reason being my boss recently hired a new employee and our office is turning into a good ole boys club where I being of the opposite sex feel out of place.  I work at a university and have worked in the same department for the past four years, my official job title is Computer Support Assistant yet my responsibilities have grown much since I started gainful employment here.  Yet now I’m feeling under appreciated as the new guy is getting paid more than me and is perhaps destined, in the near future, for a pay rise, just to stick the knife in a little deeper.    You could argue that his job title carries more clout then mine as he is officially known as a Web Developer, yet I as a lowly old Computer Support Assistant should technically be paid less, yet it appears that I have moved from the illustrious realm of shit kicker to web developer over the years, yet I still kick the shit when ever someone is in.  Technically we should be on an equal playing field, yet this too doesn’t seem to be the case.  Because I have been here the longest I am given the added responsibility of maintaining our servers while my boss lays on a beach somewhere smelling of coconut oil and slowly burning flesh.   But alas it is not to be, I must suffer in silence, I know I’ve not been very silent.  I do however feel much better now after this little venture, perhaps my foul mood was simply due to pent up frustrations which have since subsided as a result of this writing.  I feel better now and perhaps well enough to do some real work.

"I don't entirely know why I've changed 'blogs'. I used to be at diaryland.com but decided to change, as things are starting afresh.   The summer's here. Gah. Lots of thoughts swirling in my head. Waiting for other friends to officially finish their colleges etc so that the summer can commence  big time . Well, almost, I hope.   After the summer I start life in performing arts school. I'll be studying Theatre and most likely English Literature. There is no way on earth I thought I'd be sat here a year ago, winning a place in Britain's only free performing arts school. Strange. This will probably become home to future posts in the summer, and when I start school.   Things are about to change.

I never liked the first day of school because everything is messed up. I didn't even know what bus I was suppose to get on. This morning they told me something completly different than what I was told this afternoon. Most of my teachers are nice, which is a good thing of course.  I finally met my neighbor today! She's a junior and I've already met her brothers. They're all really nice. But now I dont have to ride the bus alone, so, it's all good!  I can't wait until FCA (fellowship of christian athletes) starts again. It's always an amazing experience and it's awesome because you're worshipping in school!

"Well, yesterday I went to warped tour with my gay and lesbian friends from Kiel. I have to say that it was a rocking time. I got to see Story of the Year, which blew my fucking ass away. The pure energy that just flowed off of the stage and into every soul jamming at the concert was so intense. I really didn't expect much from the other bands that I saw, basically because I knew nothing of their musical endeavors. But I would have to say that Flogging Molly and Billy Talent really left a good impression on me. So good in fact that I decieded to download their music. Illegaly of course. It was the only way I could really show my appreciation towards them. Other than not being able to hear for most of the day, it went by pretty typical. Went to the farm for a while in the morning, came home, played a little Metroid on the JNES, and reffed a meaningless soccer game. Oh, and I created this incredibly awesome web blog. Yea, that's it.

I will try to finish this one today. I have a terrible headache, so I don't know how much I will get to do.  I am working on my squares in the order, going down the left, in strips. Once I have 9 squares done, in the first row, I will attach them together and begin to really see some progress. It only has 7 strips, so once you get one done, it will go smoothly from then on out.

"Hopefully, you have figured out that my ""theme"" is William Shakespeare's  As You Like It . I, of course, am Rosalind, the strong-willed, independant young woman and Orlando is my lover. He left this morning and I was trying to find a way to dispense my emotions. I thought this would be much more exciting than a journal.    As I mentioned he left this morning. It is the strangest feeling for him to be so distant. Orlando holds in his chest the other half of my soul. I feel empty without him. They say ""absence makes the heart grow fonder."" I hope this is just a little bump in the cobble-stone street. We have been together for 3 years. Most couples are married by that time, but our ages keep us waiting. We are still young and must establish our careers first. I have small doubt that our love will fail, I just hope my Orlando will not be tempted by an Eve to eat (or whatever else) a forbidden fruit.   If the fruit is ""consumed"" I will be left with no other choice but to close the gates of Eden, not matter the pain. But once again, I have small doubt. Our love is strong and shall brave the elements! I love Orlando...as he does me.   But ""True is it that we have seen better days."" -William Shakespeare,  As You Like It

"Well this will be my first entry. Here goes.... I'm 27 and I feel like I'm going on 80. I have a huge cat and an amazing boyfriend and we all live happily together. The only imperfect thing about my Prince Charming is, He has not asked ""the"" question yet. Officially we have lived together for 1 year and including that time we have been together 1 year and 9 months. I really want to be married to him. More than anything ever. We have never fought and he doesn't annoy me. Even when he doesn't load the dishwasher correctly. I want to have a baby or two and live happily ever after. I'm not really that naive, but that is what I want. Before this one I was in a relationship that, although I'm glad it ended, was supposed to be a marriage. And when My current boyfriend (lets call him ""JB"") JB and I decided to move in together he was aware of my desire for marriage and told me he wouldn't move in if that's not where he thought we were headed. I made a deal with myself that if he did ask within a year then he is OUT. Well, I know it's hard to believe but he really is practically perfect. When I hear friends discuss the stupid, thoughtless, even rude crap their boyfriends do it just makes JB's halo shine brighter. It takes time right? There is no time limit on love....Right??? No, really, I want someone to tell me to relax. It's hard to decide whether or not to stick around and wait for a proposal or find someone who is less who I want and just get married so I can start a family. I feel like I have to choose between a GREAT guy or having kids (the bio-clock is a tickn' and I ain't gettin' younger).

"I need a job. A paying one. Not another unpaid internship where I drive 1.5 hours to get there, do crap work for 5 hours, then drive 1.5 hours to get home.   LA traffic sucks, but at least it's not as bad as Houston traffic. Or rather the drivers aren't nearly as bad. People here pretty much know how to drive. Houstonians DO NOT. They suck. They are rubberneckers to the Nth degree and cut you off and give you the finger. Here, people are calm for the most part and just sit and wait. Much nicer and more stress free.  I like it here. Maybe it's being away from family and friends that I grew up with or something but I think the only way I'll ever have a life of my own is out here. Just being around my family (who honestly are the *best* family anyone could ever hope for) makes me feel all this pressure to be someone or something. I feel like a different kind of person than them and no one has ever really made any effort to ""get"" me. I'm creative, they're not. They're obsessed with sports, I'm obsessed with tv and movies. When I'm with them I'm down on myself for not being about to get married like my cousins, or because I haven't been seeing the same person for 4 years like my YOUNGER brother. Going home to spend time with them is great, but it always makes me feel like my life is missing something because I'm not like them.   Out here, I fit in. Everyone's creative, everyone's obsessed with tv and movies. People out here have traveled and lived all over. They don't grow up in one town and marry someone they went to high school with.  I'm starting to rack up a list of former hometowns now though. Milford, Connecticut; Wake Forest, North Carolina; Poughkeepsie, New York; Houston, Texas; and Orange County, California! But I like that. It'd be sad to say I only ever lived in Milford or Wake Forest. Even if I don't *settle down* (ohhh how I hate that term) I have good stories to tell whoever'll listen!!

"I'm not a Kerry fan. I hate Bush. I will vote for Kerry.  There, I've said it.  Kerry is not the do-all and end-all of the Alternatives to Bush.  The fact is, he is the Current Alternative to Bush. I would prefer to be passionate about who I vote FOR, as opposed to being passionate about who I'll vote AGAINST.  Unfortuately, the person who stirs emotion in me for this election is Bush, and that is who I will be voting against.  The War in Iraq has a little to do with my opinion, but truth be told, I liked Bush less than I liked Gore, so Gore got my vote.  Gore stirred zero emotion/feeling in my bones, while Bush made my skin crawl.  The little scumbag liar gave me the creeps.  From the day the Republican 'Party' announced him as their candidate, I was not going to vote for him.  That being said, the party that puts a STRONG candidate in the running will get my vote.  As it stands, the parties are putting candidates out who they feel will offend the least.  That's crap.  We don't need products who are easy to advertise.  We need leaders who will do the best for America.  Bush's entire tenure can be shown in a PowerPoint presentation.   That fucker is on vacation more than anything else.  Too bad the Democrats can't come up with a candidate who stirs more emotion than 'He's got to be better than Bush'.

Chorus I want to heal, I want to feel, What I thought was never real,I want to let go of the pain I've felt so long, (Erase all the pain until it's gone) I want to heal, I want to feel, Like I'm close to something real, I want to find something I've wanted all along,Somewhere I Belong... And I've got nothing to say, I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face, (I was confused) Look at everywhere only to find,That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind, (So what am I) What do I have but negativity,Because I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me,(Nothing to lose)Nothing to gain I'm hollow and alone,And the fault is my own, And the fault is my own...

I will never know myself until I do this on my own,And I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed,I will never be anything until I break away from me,I will break away, I'll find myself today...

"Monday, 31st May 2004       Haiz! This my blog and here, i shall fill you on with the events of my life starting from today. My life starts with a quite refreshed good night's sleep. Today was quite a disaster because i fell out with my bestest fren ever, Judy. I love her so much man. Haiz, luckily we patch up le or i really dunno how miserable i will be. Life has not be going on smoothly for me and i felt so miserable. I love all mi frens, mi family, mi everything but sometimes it gets on my nerves when people just dun understand you. Anyway, despite the disaster, i managed to be happy because of Francina. She is now one of my best frens. She is always there for me. Just some numbers, and there she is, on the other end of the line, giving me good advice and comforting me. Francina is really the only comfort i find in this new school. I felt happy, glad to be her friend and know that i can always trust in her. *sigh* Today, she is going off to Holland. Passed me some of her books that are due by Friday before she left and i gave her a feather for good luck. I shall miss her when she is gone...I really hope for a better day tomorrow man...haiz...

"Well friends, it wasn't pretty but, after 3 hrs. of sleep I dragged my sorry butt out of bed to take on the mean streets of Venice, CA.  I joined my friends Samaya and Bianca to start training for the marathon.  We're part of a group called the L.A. Roadrunners (original, I know).  Do to a knee injury, I just walked today. Regardless, I'm very excited about everything going on over the next 6 months leading up to the race.  After training, we went on over to Robeck's (in the Nut) to toast our first day with shots of wheatgrass.  We even have our picture plastered on their wall.  It's not even noon yet and I've already had quite an eventful day.  Look for another post later today.  Until then, it's nap time!

"Today started like anyother monday. I woke up crabby becuse I didnt get to sleep until about12:00. I know that doesnt seem late but I need about 9 hours of sleep in order to be in a good mood. When I got to school my I heard an announcement that we had to meet in the gym at fourth period to listen to our new vice principal ramble on and on about all the new rules. Then when I got to seventh period my class got in an argument with our teacher about how to organize our binders. After I got home I did my homework and then BBQed some hamburgers for dinner. Now I'm starting a blog for the first time.

"Ok, so I went to bed at 4.48 a.m. Yes, very late. But it's not my fault! The medicine makes me sleep earlier and then I wake up and voila, its that time. So I didn't go to school all week. Oh well, and I should be studying for exams, but if I sit in a chair, I just feel like fainting. Oh, and my mother is a bitch. My computer isn't working and she refuses to call Dell up to fix the problem! Ugh!  Meanwhile, when I EVENTUALLY fall asleep, all I can dream about is my damn Biology exam. Maybe it's telling me that I should actually study. WHO KNOWS!?

"Well, for a Monday, things turned out pretty well!  I mean, I hurt a girl's feelings (Kurtis's friend Cassie), I think Justin is gonna ask me out, and i just wrote a letter to Chasen!  How exciting, huh?  Not really.  I didn't get to go to the fair Saturday because it rained most of the day.  I didn't get to go to the football game Friday because stupid Travus never called me back!  I am so mad at him by the way.  But what do I expect from Travis. I mean, it's him!  Anyhoo . . . I talked to Luke about Chasen and he says to just tell him the truth about how I feel!  Yeah, well, even if I did tell him the truth he wouldn't believe me or take me back!  That would be giving him my time that he doesn't need or want.  Kurits just called to say what's up.  How nice.  I made a buddy profile for my AIM screen name.  It is pretty cool.  I don't know.  I like it whether anyone else does or not.  Well, I am gonna leave for now.  I will probably be back later.  I am talking to Kurtis so I am getting kinda confused.   Hehe.  Talk to yuh later.

I dont care though, I only got a hour of ASD. Its my first time too so its not that big of a deal. But the thing that pisses me off is that Ryan didn't get ANYTHING! He was flicking me with a rubber band! Hmmm...well what else happened? I had the oral in spanish today, it was easy. After school Ashley came over. It was so funny, we were wired! She's the best friend ever! I can't wait till the weekend. I'm not sure what I'm doing on Friday night, but Saturday I haveta go to a cousins wedding in South Carolina. It'll be fun!

"Arghh .. I barely could move single part of my bodies, I was really burned out from yesterday's workout.  Adit asked me to join him to gym and I said, ""Hell Yeah ! Bring it On .."" but a little voice from my heart said,""are u serious about this?"" Well .. I dragged myself to Gym because I need to.  Thanks to my supportive girlfriend that said I could be able to do my all kinds of activities much faster from working out since it would stimulate both of your mind and body.  Well i think it's time for me to do my routinity, back to school in an hour and thanks God the Prof is not that boring.  O yeah .. forgot to mention about yesterday's activities .... it was a combo-day ! I did a lot of stuffs in only a single day ... i did practice of trying to imitate the solo of Dewa and Joe Satriani with my Fender Strato, I studied and worked on my homework (Finally! this is a rare thing to do), going to Gym (ran about almost 1 mile, lifted up some of machines, basketball and soccer), and called my GF =). At nite, my girlfriend threw out some matters that almost startled me ... I was surprised but on the other hand I said to myself, it;s really common to have those.   I tried to lessen her burdens, sometimes I do really want to remove all the burdens what she's got but I couldn't ... maybe I am also struggling with the same problem ...  Hopefully someday, the day when we 've matured enough would retrieve the solution. We often discussed many things and if we somewhat hurt one another's feeling, one of us standed up and said sorry. So the problem ended on that day.  Oh ... I need to prepare myself going to shcool, haven't taken a shower and breakfast ...  signed off

As another birthday comes and the candles are lit the hope that the fire department won't show up also comes to mind as much as i love fire trucks they have a tendency to ruin cakes.

"Hello friends, foes, and faggamuffins! Welcome to El Blog. I bet you're wondering how this blog came to be. What is its innate purpose? Is the world ready for it? Where can I get a good ham sandwhich at 2am?   The truth is this. Last night, I was walking my scottydog, Monty, with x-large inside-out baggie ready in hand and a mountain of frustration building. It always takes Monty at least 20 mintues to find the perfect patch of grass to excrete his waste matter upon. This is because he knows the very second that last tappering chunk hits the ground he will be whiplashed across the lawn back up into the apartment (well, ok, a slight pause as my bagged hand scoops up his hot, steaming pile). Anyway, last night, he was really taking his time. It had been 35 minutes and we had yet to find the night's sanctuary of defecation. Just as I was about to give up all hope and line the livingroom with newspaper and Bush campaign posters, he popped a squat. It was  THEN!  when I bent over to collect the night's batch that it  hit me . Yes, that one delayed missle-launched chunk,   but also   an idea!  Create my very own Blog!  And so here it is. As for the other questions, folks, I have no answers. I just ask them.

"It's true, mobile phones are great devices.  I've had one since i was 13, plan of course, not shitty pre paid which Evan always complains about, and, I've always had a regular wage earning job to pay for my phone bill.  But why are phones so great? Because they are becoming more stable, smaller/bigger, better battery life and more reliable.  I change phones every now and again, having had the ever popular Nokia 3310 for 2.5 years, followed by a Sony Ericsson T610 for 8 months, an N-Gage (POS) for a month, a Nokia 7650 for a month (old, but top phone), and currently, have a brand spanking new Sony Ericsson K700 in my possession which I've had for the last week, not even out here yet. Take a look at my precious:  http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_ericsson_k700-692.php  New, small, super tankish battery life, and a whole load of features. And yes, I can control my mobile phone bill, but a phone is essential for me as I need to be picked up from all the places I go, unless otherwise catching public transport.  But, Evan is against the 90% or whatever it is of Australians that own and use a mobile phone.

"an online journal sounds intriguing, if only to keep my thoughts in order. i have long ago given up writing in my journal due to the illegible scribble that is my long hand. the past few years would have made for some good reading and I will regret not having those thoughts to look back on. i suppose i have my memory but even that seems to be failing me in my old age or thru all the drama. drama isn't neccessarily negative but tonight i am wishing for a somewhat drama free past. tonight when i scan the postings of my name via the web, i come accross a memorial to him. someone in his High school class found out that he is dead and they are looking for stories in regards to their beloved fellow student. i sit here, at this desk and the air leaves my chest and isn't replaced for what seems like a great while. a connection to him. a connection to my soul. i miss him so much, i miss my husband, i miss nobles father. i miss sharing with him. laughing. i don't laugh so much anymore and i used to live for laughter. now when i do it seems empty and hollow. i feel fake when i am laughing. maybe the drugs will remedy that. maybe when i laugh again i will feel some connection. maybe this wonder drug will connect it all back in my brain again, but for now it seems all disconnected and although i have pretended that i have been on track for the past few years, i am a liar. my mantra has been ""it's OK"" well it fucking isn't ok, far from OK. i want to tell people that but when i do they run from me. i am always to be the STRONG woman. the strong LEADER. How imressed they all are by my resilliance. well guess what mother fuckers? it is fake. i am crumbling and you don't even know it or if you do, you don't care enough to say a thing. stay away and SUZY will pop back up like a wilted peace lily getting a much needed drink. i wish i could tell them that i am angry and that they too will understand my life when they watch their husbands die of cancer. watch as the man that you love dies while his baby grows in your belly. i was cheated. i was robbed and i have tried to make the best of it. i have waited for the best...it is alluding me. i just want some understanding, a strong shoulder to lay my head upon so that i can rest. i am tired of holding myself up. i am tired of running the show. i am exhausted and weary. where is my stamina in the form of a human?

"so first and foremost i have to give credit to nichole who brought me up to 2004 and introduced me to this whole blog thing. i have a feeling i am going to become an addict.   so i signed up for this and they asked me to fill out a profile and then proceeded to cut and paste whatever they wanted out of it. example, i wrote a whole paragraph about how i was so happy that they made the question ""name your favorite books"" because usually it just asks for one but then proceeds to ask for your favorite TV showS. i capitalize the S because they want it to be plural. as if you should be watching more TV and reading less. i guess it's easier and most people filling out these surveys are not interested in writing for hours about their favorite reads, but instead about what happened last night in nick and jessica. actually i could tell you because secretly kate and i watch it and then wonder what it would be like if MTV came and filmed us....i'll leaving wanting more only because my point of this is i am being censored in the wrong way. you see i promote reading and educating yourself, you know seeking the truth, finding your own path and they cut that shit out. what the f**k? oh i just realized this is correct, oh my bad this is the new interpretation of the first ammendment. sorry thanks for the correction. i forgot we are all suppose to be getting our news from FOX and nevermind the independent thinking it wears on the brain, let someone else do it for you. okay nevermind, just disregard what i just wrote and recommence status quo.  so already i love this blog thing except i don't think anyone is going to read it. but it's okay i already feel better, it's like free therapy...i mean someone may read it and laugh or think oh this poor girl, how pathetic...but whatever i can write about all my shit and if kate wants to catch up on what i am thinking (because she always says, ""i don't know what you are thinking"") she can log on and read instead of strong arming me into watching nick and jessica.

There were reports of people actually being so appalled at this film to go as far as slashing the screen in anger.  And it's easy to see why, to put it bluntly, I love Michael Moore.  In short, it's about the bush adminidstration and such follies and gags.  Mr. Moore goes into the very bowels of the bush admniistration(too big of a word for this late at night) and brings up all the dirty secrets that they have been hiding in the past four years.  It goes from the election, to the patriot act all the way through the war in Iraq.  Not only that, but he got to poke fun at bush the entire time.  Its good wholesome family fun.  Actually I shouldn't say that, there are in fact a lot of very graphic scenes that were incredibly hard to watch.  A lot of things that made me incredibly angry that this could ever happen.  Even though some of these things were very difficult for me to watch, it is necessary to know about such things so that we can know what is going on in our nation.  There are also  urlLink a few points  that I wanted to be put in that weren't.  This movie also made me incredibly frustrated that I, still being a minor, cannot vote on this topic.  The movie is two hours and three minutes long, is rated R and should be angering republicans in a theatre near you.

"Well, today was another eventful day of school...if that's what you want to call it. Today was a ""B"" day, so I had Adv. English; Band; Alg. II; and Adv. Biology. I really don't like these days. I mean, the only class I really like is english because Ms. Curtis is pretty cool. I don't even like band at the moment. I'll tell you more about it later. But yeah, I really hate days like this.

"Yes my first entry! I really like to do this a long time ago when I found out to one of my friends this blogspot thing.... Its cool!! No need to write... If you guys don't know yet, one of my past time is writing to my diary, I have 3 notebooks filled with stuff regarding my life and it is nice to share what’s going on with my life to my friends. I hope you can visit this page everytime. Just to let you know who I really am, and what kind of person I am (its the same thing right!) haha... So everyday I will write my high time and low time... Right now my HIGH TIME: Singing again! It’s been a long time, I love to sing and I’m going to look for a way to join the choir again. That is my passion, but do not ask me to sing in public because it's not my thing to memorize lyrics of the song, but if you will request beforehand I can sing it for you... I also sing in weddings and funerals (joke!), so if you guys need a wedding singer just give me a ring! DOWN TIME: I wasn't able to sleep well I do not know why,,, maybe because there is a lot of things going on with my mind, my work, friends and family... work because I don't know yet if I will resign or not.... it's a question and you know how hard it is to look for a high paying job so I'm still thinking it over and over and over again!!! I just hope I will find an answer this week... Friends yes I love all my friends but I miss some of them specially my PREX family, we don't have time to bond anymore because of my schedule, I really miss them and I will try to make it up to you guys! My family, yes because there is a lot of things I want to do with our house I want to buy things, but of course I need money to buy it,,,, maybe one by one I can buy things for them... specially T.V. I want to buy my mom a TV for her room so that she will be able to watch even if she is in her room.... Anyway I’m sleepy now so till next time I hope I will have time tom. To write…

Um Well I am not going out with Victoria anymore, and a lot has happend. Well I am out of school finally and I am not grounded. I feel really happy right now... I feel important.. Never really felt that way before. My new girlfriend Georgia has made me really happy inside, ya know? She makes me feel like I actually am important and thats a great feeling. My ex-girlfriend got really mad cause I was friends with girls, and cheated on me. Eh it was really dumb, and it was a friend of mine. And then she dumped me and said I could go out with anyone I would want, so I went out with Georgia. It felt like 9 months went down the drain and all that stuff. But finally yesturday she said she was sorry and ""demanded"" me to take her back. I told her I didn't wanna deal with it and move on with my own life, but I would like to be a good friend still. She got really angry and hung up the phone. Today She called me back and said she was sorry, then I told her I respect everything she says and all of her desicions. Since we broke up though I didnt really like the fact that she was trying to get me jealous by saying she is a whore by doing stuff with about literally 8 guys and going out with another... the same guy she cheated on me with. Its cool though We all take bumpy rides on the coaster of life, but we will come back. What one said before... What doesn't kill us only makes us stronger. I have become more self-dependant.. I feel more happy about it also and shit wont put me down as much... Other then that, The new Slipknot CD is awesome.

"i will start to go away     i want to say i am a free man now. i don't want to hurt anyone. specially not her coz i have hurt her a million times. as it is, i don't know if i am, i guess i am. but she's getting by. her pride and probably her resolve to make things work for her is getting her by. though i know deep inside she's hurting. because of me.  i know how i can make her really happy. but i just cannot do it now. most especially now that i have to clear out certain issues about myself.  i am contented to see her happy, no matter how contrived it is. i know she's not, deep inside she's not. but something tells me she's on her way there. she can make things work for herself. so i believe i am ready to leave her now for good. maybe slowly, i will drift away. and never bother her.  we'll finally have our separate lives. maybe once in a while i will check on her. i hope i can let her be. let her find her own peace. i will leave her for good.

"Im Tessa. Im 16 years old. My little boy Ian is now 11 1/2 months. Everyday I look at him and am just amazed by how big he's getting. my life has changed so much since I had him. I mean who could believe that just over 2 years ago I was on my way to being in the ""popular crowd"". I was Miss Suzy High School. I hated it and I hated me. Prentending that I loved cheer. Don't get me wrong cheer is great just not for me. I don't have the patcience or the determination to give up that much time to one lousy sport.   I hated pretending that I loved hanging out with my boyfriend. I gave up all my friends for him. I loved him but I definitly missed my friends. Critter was so controlling. Always telling me who, what, where, and when. He let all his friends just walk all over me.    But that's changed. I got pregnant at the young age of 14. Critter didn't want to believe it. I was making it up supposedly to get him not to break up with me. Ya right! I loved him but I'm not that pathetic. I was too scared to tell my parents. So I waited until I was 5 1/2 months along. Too far along to keep hiding it. I don't think I've ever seen my parents so mad. They were convinced that I couldn't handle a baby so I'd give him up to my parents. My mom can't have any more children and she's always wanted another. But i knew differant, I knew i could handle a baby. I fought over every little thing with them. I was so stupid about the true rights for teen parents. I believe my parents when they said that I had to do with that baby what they wanted me to. So I let them talk me into giving Ian my stepdad's last name. Ian Matthew Kubitza. Everyday since they talked me into it I've regreted it more than you can imagine.    One thing that I was right about was that I could handle a baby. I'm the one who deals with temper tantrums, dirty diapers and late nights.  Don't get me wrong, without my mom I never could have made it this far. My mom watches Ian when I go to school and when I work. I still go to school full time and I'm going to start nursing next year through a program in my HS. I can't wait. I also have a part time job now. Granted it isn't the best but hey it's something!    My life is definitly better. I don't hate myself or my group any more. I do the things in school that I want not what looks cool.

"One of my biggest downfall is that I'm too emotional. I realized this today, right now, before I logged on. My ""being emotional"" is causing a big problem. You don't realize how much you love someone until they're gone. Ever heard of it? Yeah, it's the famous cliche that you never think you can relate to.. until it happens. No it hasn't happen to me but I feel that I'm getting close and it hurts. I don't want to give up but what if he has? What if he's just ""over it""? You know that could be it. I'm all messed up. I should have stuck to the idea that he's too good for me. I told him from the beginning that I'm no good for him but he wouldn't listen. He just wanted what he couldn't have and now he has it he doesn't want it. Why? I'm mean, why do people function like this? I have to admit, I don't exclude myself from this terrible disease. But why? Why do people always want what they can't have? Because it's challenging. That's it.  I need some alone time. Some time to think things through. When I told him yesterday that the longer we are together the more scared I get, I did mean the more scared I get to lose him but as I was thinking today, I think I am scared. I don't know of what because I've been wanting this for so long now. After I got baptized, this just became more real than ever. This is it Antoinette. This is all for real. No joke. So what's so scary about that? I guess this is what they call cold feet. This is the time that the questions start rolling in. Do I really want to tie down so soon? Can I help make it work FOREVER? Will the love last FOREVER? Do I really love him? Does he really love me? Is this really love? Are these even questions you bring up in a deep, deep conversation? Am I being too emotional? I need some alone time. Some time to think things through because this is for real. No joke. I want to do the right thing because deep down inside my little heart, it sure feels like the right thing.

This week, for instance...I come down with something earlier in the week, end up missing two days at work, and things just fall apart while I'm gone. This results in me having to play ""catch-up"" for at least the next week.  This isn't the first time this has happened, either. Not two months ago the same thing happened, and on top of everything else, I still had to go in to fix a problem that no-one else at work could.  On one hand, it's nice to be needed.

I'm sitting in my recently-painted TV room watching some show about ancient man-made things found off the island of Malta.  It's typical Science Channel stuff.  I love anything like that.  I'm also sitting in various chat rooms right now, but not really monitoring what is going on in them.  But if someone wants to chat me, that's cool.  I'll chat back -- maybe.  The TV room is now Ruby Red.  Or as a friend of mine called it -- ""Ho Red"".  It was a bitch to paint.  But I did it all myself.  It took one coat of primer and 4 coats of the red.  There is still minor color differentiation, but you can't really see it that much.  I'm probaby the only one that would notice them.

"Okay, so I just spent $50.00 bucks on a optical mouse.  It was either that or spend the money on food or shoes.  The new pet is a Logitech MX510 optical mouse, it is a cool maroon color and if you want to buy into the sales pitch each color is unique with no two the same.  The performance spec's are what cinched the deal for me..i did not even know that they had performance specs.  I got 5.8 megapixel per second image processing, 800 DPI resolution, and the solar flare reductor units are top of the line from NASA.  So technically with all this going for me, my online gaming experience should now vastly improve as I fight for world domination with 13 year olds (yeah right).  The one, for real thing is I did find a article about the mouse in Maximum PC magazine.  It got thier trademark (kick ass award).  That has to be worth $50.00 bucks.

"My opinion on peoples   faith   is   different  . I dont think that anyone can determine how much faith someone has, and I dont think that other people should   judge   someone elses faith. God is apart of   everyone's life   one way or another.   Mostly   everyone knows who God is and the principles behind Him. I think that the way that people   deny   Christ's name so easily is  wrong , but Im not them, so I cant make their decisions for them. But what I can do, is I can work my hardest to be a Godly   example   so that they can see what the Christian life is all about. Being a Christian   isnt   always   fun  . Yes, there are always the occansionally   disappointment   that we run into and from what I have heard, alot of people   blame God   for their   mishaps  . Well, as hard as this might sound, its all apart of God's   master plan  . God allows some misfortunes to happen, to   test   your level of faith that you might have in Him.   BUT  , know this, God will   never   test you with more than you can   handle  .  Beliving in  Christianity  or  Evolution . Either one that you believe in  requires   faith!   Faith- believing in something that you cannot see.

"Sometimes I have a crazy notion that runs through my head.  It's actually more like a recurring question that puzzles me at odd times and places but usually when I see some otherwise taken for granted ingenious invention.  For example, it happened this past Sunday as I sat in an Emergency Room waiting area (a friend had been bitten by a dog...) as I watched the automatic sliding glass doors.  What a wonderful and convenient invention.  A sensor detects your presence and opens the door.  Then it hit me...What would Benjamin Franklin think of that?   I think of Ben and what he would think quite often when I hear the telephone ring, see airplanes in the sky or cars on the road.  Just the idea of electricity (that covers lights, the radio, television, motion pictures...The list is endless), the concept of the internal combustion engine, the physics of flight...  Just think of how much fun it would be to tool around with Ben showing him all the things we've manage to create.  Can you imagine explaining how man has walked on the moon?  How would he react to hearing that we have a satellite circling, capturing data, recording it and reporting back to Earth from the planet Saturn?  We have come so far and have so much.  Ben would be very impressed with everything...   That's usually when another of my recurring thoughts hits me.  He'd be impressed with all the gadgets and inventions but eventually he'd see what kind of society we've become.  He'd be appalled by our lack of education in light of all the technological marvels.  Sure, it took a smart person somewhere to figure out the concepts of the new technology...But look what we've given up in return.  For all our efforts we have people that can't read and write...People that don't have or use their imaginations...People that can't think for themselves...People that are happiest doing no more than mindlessly doing nothing.  Our Great Society has become stupid, ill mannered, uncaring and lazy.  It's a shame really.  And I'm certain that Ben wouldn't like it...

He seemed to be everything I wanted in a man and he had made  me believe that I was everything he wanted in a woman, we had shared pictures a lot of pictures so he new what I looked like and I new what he looked like, well this guy was just to good to be true just a wonderful man he would tell me he loved me and how he wanted a future with me. He decided that he had to come see me so after two weeks of talkin and getting to know eachother through conversation  he shows up on my door step at around 1 am on Saturday morning. I aswered the door and he was just as beautiful as his pictures but I could tell I wasn't everything he imagined id be. I still had a day and a half with this guy and I new he didn't like me the way he said he did because of the way I looked can you imagine the heartache of rejection when its slapped in your face?Well he ended up staying the whole time and we had a nice time, we took my girls to see a movie and he came to my mothers house for dinner and what not! We did sleep together but I feel like he did it out of pity for me. It just hurts to be rejected by someone who tells you they love you and how beautiful you are,I told him how scared I was to meet him cause I didn't want to disappoint him but he said ""what do you think I'm a shallow person? I think your beautiful and I want to be with you"". So now here I am 2 days later not one phone call from him and a broken heart to deal with!

I will conclude this post with two of my favoriate quotes.  One : ""Never give in, Never, Never, Never, Never,- in nothing great or small, large or petty, never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense"" - Wintson Churchill Two : ""Do not medle in the affairs of dragons, for that are crunchy and taste good with Ketchup."" - Unknown.

I believe that that we, as humans, are scared that other ""beings""(aliens, animals, that sort of thing) are smarter than us. we want to stay on top of the food chain as dominating race. we try to find other life forms, but half heartedly, we cannot cope with others trying to show us good things(if not that, what else?).

"So these two girls published an article in the school newspaper about the cliques in my school. It's a horrible article. Like, get shot in the head and die. In it they listed what cliques exist at my school--The Asians (it's funny they list that as the first one, because thats the 'clique' they belong to) the Brown kids, The Ghetto Group, The Cheerleaders/Jocks/Preps, the Punks, the Goths and the Druggies. Okay, what the hell? There are 3 kids at my school that could be labeled punk. Two of them are actually Punks, and one of them is a good friend of mine. The other one is a girl who used to be punk, but now she's all...not. This entire article is about how we shouldn't be labeling kids because HEY!  That's what causes cliques!  And then they go and categorize every student at the school? Assholes.  And then, they thought it would be nice to teach me about these cliques.  Students feel acceptance and approval when they are with their ""own people"". How does one come to be labeled as a part of one of these cliques? The way one speaks, dresses common interests and tracking levels.   Tracking levels? Okay! I have no idea what that means.    Students who can be categorized in more than one clique are considered ""confused"". For Example, we were listening to two studens in our class talk about a boy who likes to dress more urban but he listens to rock music at the same time. People were making fun of the boy behind his back saying he was ""confused"".  Cry me a fucking river.  The article goes on about stupid shit. Saying that the two most segregated clubs in my school are DECA and the Multicultural Club. Ironically, THEY'RE IN BOTH.  Oh, I don't want to join that club...It's so...Asian  What the hell. People use that as an excuse?  They ended it by saying that the only way to change this is to make a difference...within. Fucking Hippies.  On that note, all i have to say is...    We can dance if we want to, we can leave your friends behind  'Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance  Well they're no friends of mine     Amen.

"Ah, what a tangled web we weave.  To say im involved in some sort of bizarre love triangle would be overdoing it.  But, in a sense, maybe thats what it is.  In order to sort this out, I should start from the beginning.  I was working in a rehab for brain injured adults when I met her.  She was a petite spunky girl recently arrived in the area from california.  Some how or another, she showed interest in me and begain inviting me places outside of work.  I didn't really care, I was a student supporting myself and dealing with roomate problems, housing problems, getting to class on time, getting to work on time...the whole in and out of survival.  But, while im not all that great at subtle hints, she was aggressive enough for me to pick up on the fact that she liked me.  And so, after a long night of drinking and a bit of passing out and *unkowningly* spooning her, our relationship began.  It was cool, did all the great things you during a new relationship: trips to the beach, visiting the family, staying up late talking, holding hands, doggie style sex...(heh).  At some point, irresponsible as we were there was an abortion.  I dont want to go into here how bad that affected me; for her, I can only imagine it was much worse experience; but, it was her request and I supported it.  I do know having to walk through a thong of anti-abortion assholes didnt make it easy at all.  Not to mention I wanted to choke the living hell out of a few of em.  Time passed and the relationship seemed good.  Then, one day, she told me she was moving back to california and wanted me to come after I graduated in a semester.  I wasnt too sure about this; but, I agreed.  She left.  Afterwards, I continued to go to school and doubt settled in.  Perhaps I should break up with her?  Next installment....I move to california, relationship ends, we become friends...and then the web grows more complicated....

I'm not in the mood to dwell on serious topics like this right now..so i'll be moving on to something a bit happier.  I'm going to a cottage tomorrow with a whole bunch of my friends. Its in Grand Bend, right on the main strip. I hope its fun. It will be...we always have fun together. I dunno though, for some reason im not really looking forward to it. Maybe its because I just started to like this guy Matt, and I dont want to leave and not be able to talk to him. I know its only for a few days, but im in that ""just srarting to like someone"" phase, and i like talking to him as much as possible. Oh well, the week will go by really fast, and Ill be back here, and able to talk to him as much as i want. Well, its been a pretty boring day...not much to talk about.

So I laid in bed for a few moments, blinking stupidly, then heard my mom yelling somehting from what seemed like really far off, and I realized all of a sudden that it was the SMOKE DETECTOR going off!! So I jumped out of bed and opened my door, and this WALL of smoke came pouring in! I quickly woke up my brothers and got them outside, then went back in to investigate. I hurried over to our kitchen, and arrived just in time to see out microwave melt and fall into pieces!! Our kitchen was in flames, the walls, the counters, the floor, the stove, microwave, refridgerator...Oh man. My dad somehow put it out, and I am now practically living in my basement, while about 500 people come over every day to repair or clean our house. Wow. So that was my adventure for this week.

Her parents were over this way so we all went down to the Bellevue Arts and Crafts fair.   While there I completely mastered the art of breastfeeding Riley while walking with her in the sling. I love it! I don't even think anyone really knew what I was doing. Corey's dad even asked if she was sleeping.  So cool! I do need a new sling though. I think I am going to make one myself.   Today we all went to church. It was our seminarian, Kahn's, last day. So we went downstairs for doughnuts after mass. Then we came home and Riley was asleep so we did some marathon cleaning.   Robbin stopped by to say hi and reminded me of the heart fabric that she made Riley's curtains out of. (she gave me the excess). So I made Riley some cute pants.

"Acts 20:24--  But my life is worthless unless I use it for doing the work addignes me by the Lord Jesus--the work of telling others the Good News about God's wonderful kindess and love.        Unless I am living my life to do the    work of God  ,    then my life is  worthless.  Not sharing  Christ 's  love  with anyone and everyone is something that should make me feel   guilty  . And I can honestly say that it does. Living 4 Christ    24/7  is my title because I feel like I am supposed to live for Him  24/7 !      Galations 2:20--  I myself no longer live, but Christ lives in me. So I live my life in this earthly body by trusting in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.       Like what I said in the first one, my life is  worthless  unless I use it to share God's love. Well, I cannot do it alone, so Christ lives in me to   help   me and to   guide   me. Allowing  God to live inside of me , gives me a great deal of  comfort.  How else could you feel more comfortable? Having the Son of God inside your  heart  and knowing that He loves you and would do   anything   for you...that's and   amazing   feeling! And I'm so glad that I get to experience it   everyday!

We have to keep a blog for three days and then email the address to him so he can see how it's going. My Bio teacher has to be the most boring man alive. He wont look at anyone when he is talking and his voice is monotone. He told us today that one of his hobbies is to go to southern California to catch spiders to keep in the class room. He also told us that his job before he was a teacher was to go through a jar of goop takeing out all the fish larva and fish eggs. he seemed pretty proud of it. I think it was pretty pathetic.

"After I followed a link to the ""I Love Bees"" blog from  urlLink www.penny-arcade.com  I decided it was about time I actually started my own blog. About six months ago I had started an online journal, but at the time I was drowning myself in Smirnoff frequently (daily) and lacked the motivation to sit down and write. I think now I have the time and mind to actually keep up with this.  When signing up for my blog, I could not for the life of me think of a name for it that would be worthy. I stopped right there. If I don't have a decent name for my blog, what's the point? I figured, something would come to me eventually and it did. I saw Garden State last night (Go see it, it's fantastic!) and it gave me the name for my blog. The movie sums up all the thoughts and feelings going through my mind at this moment in life, thus, my Infinite Abyss will be this blog. I hope you enjoy it.

"So, this is the first time I have ever posted something. Been thinking about a lot lately, so this might seem to be pretty random.  Things are changing all around, but I don't really think any of it is really going to make much of a difference. Out with the old, in with the new. New managers to work with at work. New owners to work with at work. Everything is new at work, except for me and what I do. Show up, talk to agents, managers, publicists, local bands, local press, etc. Book shows, promote shows, settle shows. It's almost getting to a point where I feel like I am going through the motions. I don't get as excited as I used to about bands. I'm probably just a lit bit jaded, but I hate booking shows like W.A.S.P., and ICP and all that other crap. At least by booking these shows, I get the resources to book the bands that I like. Just take the good with the bad.  About to be an uncle for the first time. Pretty excited about that, but I'm kind of scared for my sister. I just hope that she and her boyfriend are able to raise the baby together. I think it would crush her if he ends up leaving. I know that it will all work out in the end, but I have a feeling that it might be kind of a rocky road.  Been thinking about life and love a little bit too much lately. I really miss what it's like to be in a relationship with someone. It's been two years now, and I still find myself thinking about the good times I had with Colleen from time to time. It's not that I miss her, I think I just miss the idea of having someone like her to have around. It's nice to be able to see someone everyday and not get sick of them. Someone with whom I can share my thoughts and feelings.  On a similar note, I think it's time that I start taking care of myself a little bit more. I know that with my personality, I will always want to go out and have a good time. In turn, I think it's time I get off my ass and start trying to be healthier. Thinking about giving up meat again. We shall see. I know that if I manage to lose about 30 lbs, my confidence about my appearance will be a lot higher. Probably would help with the idea of trying to date again.

"I'm sitting here at 2:30 A.M. wondering . . . is it possible to fall in love with a place?  Is it possible to want to be somewhere so much that you would forsake everything . . . just to have a moment in that place?  I think that is what Chicago is to me, as corny as that may be.  I'm interviewing for jobs at the moment, and I can't sleep.  Part of me really wants the job, but another part wants to fly on a whim.  I know what I   should   do, but there is a great difference between what you should do and what you want to do.  I am so nervous right now--about the job, about the possibility of moving, about everything.  I'm literally at a time in my life when I am in serious upheaval.  It's a transition period, and I don't like it.  I wish I had a crystal ball that would tell me where I will be in five years, ten, twenty even.  Maybe then I would know the path that I am supposed to take.  But no one can tell you that, can they?  You can only do what you feel you should and hope that it is the right decision.  Jen

"I finally gave in. I spent six years in a Theatre department (I wasn't the most devoted student) and somehow avoided Karaoke, but last night I made my way down to the Bandana Brewery in lovely Mankato for Tuesday night karaoke. It was just as bad as I thought it would be. I know some people go for the comedy aspect, but to me it just seemed sad, not to mention new-countryish. I mean, I don't want to hear the Dixie Chicks sing a Dixie Chicks song; why would I want to hear tone-deaf drunkards sing a Dixie Chicks song. The one bright spot was the older couple who sang classic country. They had pipes. The guy did a nicely phrased version of  Folsom Prison Blues , and the woman did a sweet and sad  Crazy.  It almost made it worth sitting through the 5'6"" cat in shades who jerked his shoulders through Metallica.

"I had nothing to say about this writing. It comes suddenly in my mind but it also because something has happens during that day.  I know what I am, who am I. I can’t be myself even it’s me somehow. Confused rite?? I want changing. I want to change my life.  This day something happens. For the moment I want to screammm.. and cry but I can’t. Why?? I forget how to cry anymore. What’s wrong with me?? Why I can’t overcome myself. It’s that fear that I scared. You asked me what the hell do I want?? I don’t know anymore. I just like normally people, want everything. But why I can’t?? Is that my fault?? Am I that boring?? But I supposed I also have that kind of chances right??  Flash back. We just met a few months ago. I thought we could be a good friend. But now I realize that just a dream, sweet dream. I am just realizing that there is no chemistry between you and me. I never enjoyed when I with you. Is that because of the chemistry?? I think yes because no matter what I say, what I do it’s wrong in your eyes. Am I really that clumsy?? I wonder do I really look like that?? Why I can’t overcome myself. It’s that fear that I scared. Can I let go my fear?? Oh God, I never asked you anything. I just want to be loved. Is that wrong?? Am I asking too much??  Oh please someone tell me what am I supposed to do. I am also a human too. I need love and loved someone. Do I have any options left behind?? I think answer of all this question is giving me a time to change. Change into what?? Do not ever dream that I would ever beg you to come back or kneel on my knee. Tell you I have my pride and I won’t let you pity on me. No matter what, I will survive. I am not asking you to come back I just wonder.. Have I done something wrong??  You once said that I am too kind. Is that wrong to be kind?? What’s wrong with that?? I don’t understand. Is that making you sick?? And I want to know what’s wrong to wear mask and to be somebody else who is better than me. Even it’s not me but now its parts of me now. I thought what the most important is just do whatever you think is right. I don’t care what people say about me. Let them say anything they like. Makes them happy. Or are they jealous with me?? I wonder.. Outside I might seem perfect and happy but don’t judge the book by its cover. No body’s perfect so am I. So what do you think of me now??

"Well tonight things finally came to a collapse. Erika has finally decided she can't try and hold on to what we have had going for over 3 years. After a long talk on the phone, and her broken down in tears, many kind words exchanged back and forth, a little bit of laughter now and then, but mostly silence, trying to decide what to say. She has decided to stick with Troy because he is there for her, since i live 8 hours away. My heart was broken, after 3 years of keeping it going. I will cherish the last time i saw her, only 3 weeks ago, driving 8 hours leaving at 1 in the morning on a spur of the moment to go see her because my parents were out of town. Spending a whole day, and night with her was the most amazing thing i have ever experienced. After cuddeling all night, and falling asleep, we woke up early in the morning, and both started getting closer. Eventually, we ended up making sweet love for the first time which is the most amazing thing i have ever experienced with her. Only a few hours later i had to go home. Then, tonight, i found out that the big pit i was feeling in my stomach the other night was true. This past weekend she went and did it with Troy....I cant explain how i felt. I know they were dating but i was shocked. We talked some more, trying to work things out, but you know it doesnt work out that great. Both said a few things we shouldnt. She wanted to try and get rid of our emotions for each other, she said all her stuff, then i asked her if she really wanted me to say how i felt, and she said yes. After a long time of me talking, she was shocked of how much i really felt for her because this was truely the first time i was able to tell her i dreamed, and wanted to marry her someday. But, i was too late. She is with troy for the past couple months, if only i could have told her sooner my true feelings, but i didnt; now i am too late to care for her, she said its over forever. Hopefully i will still be able to talk to her. Night ended with a long silence, i could hear her crying in the background, a long silence, and the line goes dead. I am dieing, and really need to talk to her, call once, twice, 5 times, 7 times, 4 voicemails later, i give up, give one last call to tell her sweet dreams and have a good day at school. Then i head to the gym to try and work off some of what this night has brought. I have decided to write down the Soap Opra we have had for the past 3 years......

"so i'm back from my family vacation and it was alright...i guess the best thing about the whole trip was actually seeing my entire immediate family (divorced parents, my sister and her 2 children, my son and myself) together...family is a blessing and i'm grateful for it...i did get a chance to spend some time on the beach by myself...i'm glad that i called my main home girl who advised me to claim what i needed and that was some time without my son...being on the beach and standing in front of water and talking to god was very refreshing...i asked god to give me clarity with my relationship with ""him""  then things got interesting...i got an phone call from ""keys"" and he expressed to me that it would have been nice if i came to visit him and asked how i would have responded to advances he may have made...after all this time, i really do honor our friendship and would not want to cross any lines that cannot be reversed...plus, i must honor what ""he"" and i are experiencing now and must give the respect that i ask of him...right?

"Today is shaping up to be an extremely frustrating day.  For some reason, whenever B has Guard Duty, the kids think that it is a good time to be their most obnoxious.  And to top it all off, my period is due tomorrow which cuts my tolerance in half.  I have been so exhausted the last couple of days, I'm not sure if there is something going around or if it just the 10 years of interupted sleep that is finally catching up with me.  I have no energy and all I want to do is eat.  I need to get out and do something.  Still mulling over the idea of a move to AL.  Sometimes the thought of starting over in a new place is very refreshing and at other times, terrifying.  Truth is though, I probably don't have the drive to move this whole family.  And I know that B is pretty happy right where we are, if he got a little better job we would probably be very comfortable, and wouldn't even be considering a move.  I've done so much work with tweaking his resume and getting it out there that every time he has an interview and it doesn't work out, it almost feels like a rejection of me.  Stupid I know, and he totally takes it in stride, but I am starting to get frustrated that people don't see his potential and qualifications.  Well, I should really get busy and get something done today, there is a ton of laundry to put away and maybe I'll bake something.  It is a gorgeous day out and not too hot yet, so it is great weather for baking.

"After much encouragement from my tech-savvy boyfriend, I’ve decided to get on board with the concept of blogging. As a writer, it only makes sense that I find an outlet to document my thoughts. However, I still kinda feel like Doogie Houser at the end of an episode when he would type a couple of sentences on his old school computer to both sum up his day and offer some sort of introspective look at the universe. Remember how he would always pause right before the last few words? That lame theme music would play as he contemplated the perfect vocabulary to capture the essence of his experience. And then he would always type the last couple of words r-e-a-l-l-y s-l-o-w-l-y. I guess that was a primitive form of blogging.   I still find the concept of putting your thoughts out for the world to read intimidating and intriguing. I mean, why would anyone care what I had for breakfast or thought of a movie I had recently seen? I guess it’s just like having a diary, but how personal can a blog get if you know everyone can read it? Regardless, I feel that writing for leisure again instead of just for work will be a positive experience for me.

"I understand     It is defined by truth and reality, it is not the love I feel for you that is truest, and it is my action in response to that love.  I love you because in china a butterfly flapped its wings.  I love you because the centrifugal force of the earth’s rotation makes me.  I love you because you are whole and sane and so beautiful it hurts to touch you.  I love you because at night your sweet dreams move your body closer to mine, skin touching for days it seems.  I love you because when I wake next to you and the sun shines over our bodies, Mother Nature tells me this is the most natural thing I can ever have.  Human life is but a mili-second in the big picture so there is no time to waste.  In the morning you smell of sweet vanilla when I press my face into your neck.  Your breasts curving so gracefully, I watch the lines of your body and try to memorize them.  Your fingers so soft and strong…not to dainty and not to hard.  It’s the kind of thing you wish for when you are single, or at least when I was single, and lucky enough I got what I wanted, no less and no more.  At night when you wrap your legs around me I almost melt.  Your sweet lips covering me like a cotton sheet of sweet desire.  True is your love for me.

"I just got back from seeing the movie I, Robot starring Will Smith.  Let's just say I was just a tidge disappointed in the movie.  First of all, when I heard that this movie was coming out I picked up the book (not the misleading one with Will Smith on the cover).  I was fascinated by the book in the fact that it was a series of vignettes about the evolution of robots from mindless machines to a species equal to ours, all shown through the eyes of a robot pschoanalyst.  I thought these stories were amazing and saw a definite flow to all the unlinked stories.  This made me very intriqued about how the movie was going to be.     I had read that Alex Proyas was going to take liberties with the plot, but keep Isaac Asimov's vision intact.  I believe he failed, miserably.  What Mr Proyas made was just another unbelievable action movie that appeal to the dense overly stimulated action freak with none of the intended vision to what he speaks of.  It is sad really there was so much emotion and cerebral moments that were lots in the mindless CGI and laws of physics bending fight sequences that have been over used by ever movie since the first Matrix.  In fact they should have called this a Matrix prequal that George Lucas would have been proud of (including the apparently useless sidekick kid from Even Stevens that didn't have to do with anything in the story except a cheap laugh, can you say JAR-JAR).       There was some redeeming value, there was some witty dialogue that kept the plot interesting.  But of course, like all Will Smith movies, there was far too many pointless one-liners.   Another point was the fact that the leading lady wasn't just some no brain supermodel which was hard to believe that she actually could read the script (Denise Richards in The World is Not Enough), but they found some one less than perfect who was actually believable though still too young to be a brilliant scientist.       Overall the movie was entertaining, but not something that Asimov would have been proud to go see.

"You wanna know why this girl looks how she looks?  Well this poor little girl was forced by me to talk with me  for more than an hour.  Hmm you wonder why I did this?  Well lets start with the background  Since Simon (a class mate of mine) invited us to a grill party, this became a tradition. The photo was taken at such a party and me being very drunk started  to talk to every girl telling her such great things like  ""You're the horniest in our gradates!"" or ""You can run but I'll  always find you""  Well for this not being embarassing enough I looked for a victim I can talk to for longer time, well there she was!  This time I was in love with a chubby cheeked girl named Karen. Luckily my ""conversation partner"" was the best friend of her. So the conversation was only about how Karen and I match together.  You can imagine that me being very drunk said things, which I had better not said.  Finally I can only say that I don't remember all the stuff I told her, but my opinion about relationships and what is important in such relationships were the best things I told her, because now everybody knows what a horny  guy I am with my 17 years.  Well this evening seemed to be a turning point of my imagination for a  relationship with Karen, because later she wanted to clear some things, between me and her. This resulted in a telephone conversation for about nearly two hours. The only thing I can conclude from this session is that she is an ecological cunt, who thinks that she is something better than others.  One reason, which lets me conclude so is that a friend of her told me that Good-naturedness was the only reason why she talked to me.  Well I didn't knew that every person, who talks to me is just good natured. I don't think that conversation is a thing of Good-naturedness, because if so the world will get egoistically and it will become a privilege to talk to someone else.  Sorry but here it seems that sombebody stayed too long in the broad sunlight. Maybe she planted too many patches, which is what she does right at the moment :D  This is it for now, I hope you enjoyed reading this and I hope I could give you a small view of my life.  Greetz

I will also include screenshots and parts  of the story. Thats all that really happened. I also  have a lot of energy all of a sudden. I feel like  getting outside and doing all kinds of things. But  it's getting late so I'll do stuff tommorrow. I write  whenever I can/feel like it/have the time.

"Hey Im Doug, for those that don't know me Im Raul's brother,for those that don't know Raul,Im a pretty kool kid;thats why I named this blog Kool Kids Blog.   Well since I just Introduced myself, I will you a few thing about myself.   Im fifteen years old and Im going to NDSS(North Delta Senior Secondary) in september.   Can't wait to attend High school, it's going to be so kool But Im still kinda nervous to be a little kid again.   When I was in Junior high I was in grade 10, I thought I was the king of the school;everyone thought I was kool,I had the koolest friends and I had supuriority over the little Grade 8's and 9,s.    But since Im going to   Grade 11 Im going to become inferior to the Grade 12's,not to mention the other Grade 11's.   Basically what Im trying to say is that I will have to make a new image of myself,make new friends,make new enemies.   Most kids in my class barely passed Math10 this school year,I can't imagine how hard Grade 11 math is.   Im going to take Band in Grade 11,I was the best Trumpet player in my school but I know next year Im going to have tough competition, which kinda sucks because I had the worst band teacher this year.   Ms Robinson, the worst band teacher ever;she held me back so much that Im going to have to practice really hard for next year,STUPID TEACHER.   Ms Robinson, tried to teach me and my friends to play guitar even though she DOESNT KNOW HOW TO PLAY GUITAR.   Last year Mrs Lucas left band teacher position,she was the best teacher ever;she let us play good music but then Ms Robinson filled in for her and she made us play crappy music.   My friends hated her too, o-well.   My friends think Im on drugz but I don't know why,I think my lack of sleep might make me look like Im on drugz.   Im tired of typing Im going to take a nap or something, so if you want to talk about stuff then add me to your messenger at  urlLink Gangstar41145@hotmail.com  or  urlLink Mr_mcneil_32@hotmail.com  .   Have a nice day.

"Today was Teddy Bear day at Alexander's daycare. All of the kids in his class were supposed to bring Teddy Bears, yesterday they made Teddy Bear books out of construction paper - you get the picture. Alexander does not like to get boxed in to conventional thinking so he interpreted it as ""pet"" day. This opened up his entire stuffed animal collection to be taken to school. Alexander chose his Big Bird to take to school, but it is no ordinary, stuffed, Big Bird. Oh no. This one was given to him as paybacks for some annoying toy that my wife or I gave to someone else's child. This Big Bird has a whole bunch of games that you can choose by squeezing his toes. He also has a backpack full of blocks that have letters, numbers, and shapes. You put a block into his hand and talks about it, depending on which game you picked. Sounds good on paper, right? The catch is that some deviant toy maker endowed this Big Bird with the most annoying, nasal voice - and it has no off switch. That's right. Once you awaken the bird, it starts talking, trying to get the child to play, it waits a few seconds, and then tries again, and again, and again.... Remember how I said that there is no off switch? Yeah. I imagine that the designers of this toy are in a witness protection program somewhere. Think about how this toy got made - in some corporate meeting room, an assortment of marketing, technical, sales, and other people got together - probably many times, reviewed this design, and decided that it was a good idea. Anyway, this is what Alexander took to school. I thought that I had hidden it better than that, but I was mistaken. Anyway, when I took him into his room, his teacher thought that The Bird was cute - and then he awakened it. I chose that moment to beat feet out of there. In the evening when I returned to pick up Alexander, his bird was not in his cubby with his blanket and other things. It was on top of the cabinets as far out of reach as the teachers could make it. They must not like that voice, either.

"Hi you, this is me. Me, this is you.  Now that introductions are over, I'm gonna give you a chance to get to know me. Don't screw this up, or yknow, nothing will happen. I think I should point out that this is my first blog ever. and it's something I decided to do on a whim at 8 o clock on a Sunday night after I basically got fired from my job.  Oh, did I pique your interest?  Well if I did, here's what happened. Yesterday, I called in and told them I would be picking up my two weeks notice, this got miscommunicated as ""Hey, I'm quitting right now"" and as I went in today, I was asked ""Didn't you quit."" Anywho, to make a long story short, I ended up in a mixture of quitting/getting fired.   Im fine with it, I have to start school in a couple week anyway.  But that's in the past, and Im sure no-one reading this is interested in my past, only what might future might hold, and exactly where my present lies.  So here's the present: I'm a guy. I have a girl. Me and said girl just got gerbils on Saturday. The gerbils names? Cactus Jack Daniels and Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves. They're outlaws! :)  I am unemployed as of today and going back to school in a couple of weeks. I've never been especially good in school, but not because I'm dumb. It's because I've never decided to go through the effort of doing anything in class, or at home for that matter. I guess that is pretty dumb. For what it's worth though, I ace all my exams.  The girl, y'know, the one I was telling you about before? The on with the gerbils, well, she is my love, and my everything. You'll definantly hear reference to her later in my blogging adventure.    I have just decided that I should change names to protect all of the people involved in my eccentric adventures, y'know, don't want to leave all their things laying about for their mom to find now do we?  I'll decide on names later, but i think the gerbils will get to keep their names as they are. For now however, Jack and Robbie are making a lot of noise, so, I'll post what I have and go attend to them, maybe I'll write something else later.

"This is my blog to the world…  …that never blogged to me (apologies to Dickinson, check it out at www.bartleby.com).  What a fitting first posting to my blog!  Clever.  Blogs are the ultimate in one-way communication, brought to us by the infinite self-publishing capabilities of the web.  Children in Beijing and the editorial staff at Al Jazeera can find out with the click of a mouse what I have to say about anything.  Everything!  If it crosses my mind, it will cross theirs, yours, everybody’s.  The good folks at the Independent School Technology Letter have come to yours truly, bloggingman, to get everybody hip to blogs.  Can do.  In fact, we decided to blog our way through the topic, for real.  Is there any other way to communicate?  From me to you.  I am giving Sherry and Will privileges to post to the blog as we go along, so they can help me keep it straight and blog it into shape.  What, you ask, is a blog?  Where you been?  If I spelled it ‘blog, would that give you a clue?  Right, it’s short for web log.  “Log”: noun, a record of performance, events, or day-to-day activities (check it out at www.m-w.com), and you know what “web” is.  I’m keeping track of things in my log, which I publish on the web, hence this is my web log, or blog.    Of course, all blogs exist in the blogosphere.  “Blogosphere (alternate: blogsphere) is the collective term encompassing all weblogs. Weblogs are heavily interconnected; bloggers read other blogs, link to them, and reference them in their own writing. Because of this, the interconnected blogs have grown their own culture” (check it out at: en.wikipedia.org).    Blogs have become incredibly popular, even in schools, which is where I work (identity concealed).  In fact, a guy at NECC this year said “you must blog.”  If I must…  So here I go.  Kinda catchy, “you must blog it.”  When a problem comes along  You must blog it  Before a thought sits out too long  You must blog it  When something's going wrong  You must blog it   now blog it  into shape  shape it up  get straight  go forward  move ahead  try to detect it  it's not too late  to blog it  blog it good   That’s the ticket!  Blog it good!

"So...this is my first entry in my blog.  I've had blogs before, but I seem to never update them...and then I forget what the website is to my blog.  Hopefully I'll update this one.  So, my name is Tiffany, I live in Virginia Beach, and I'm going to be a sophomore at Princess Anne High School in September.  I am a Madrigal in my school's chorus, which is supposed to be an honor, but it really isn't.  My best friend is Keeley.  She is so awesome and is just like me; we met at the beginning of the school year, when she moved here from San Diego.  Which is kind of funny because that is where I was born.  We were very lucky this year to go traveling together with our school.  We are both drama geeks and got to go to a thespian conference at Longwood University and we also got to go to New York City, which was absolutely amazing.  After going to New York I decided that I am going to move there when I get out of high school.     Anyways... I am currently in a production of the play Twelfth Night by Shakespeare.  It has been such an amazing experience and I have made some great friends.  First there's Matt... he is so sexy, talented, and fun to be around, but unfortunately he is gay.  Then there's Sam... he is also sexy, talented, and fun to be with, but he has a girlfriend who he is absolutely in love with.  Rebekkah, who is almost exactly like me, is so much fun to be with...""She kills me!""  Unfortunately, we only have three more performances and then it's all over.    Well that's all I really have to say right now.... but I'll right more later.

"I came to work today, checked my e-mail and there sitting in my inbox was an e-mail.  An e-mail from someone I went to High School with.  Someone I haven't spoken to in about 8 years.  I got that kind of panicky feeling before opening it. I always expect the worst.  Was she going to tell me about some unexpected tragedy that had befallen her or a mutual friend or even worse relate how wonderful her life has been since graduating.  Of course, it was the latter.  She's married, has a house, baby on the way, and has a great job.  Oh my Gawd, I can't breathe....  How can I compete with that? I'm still figuring out what to do with my life and right now I'm not even close.  I have a boyfriend and we've been together almost 4 years but we have no definite plans of getting married. And kids?  That isn't even a thought.  We are in escrow now for a house but every day feels like we are periously close to losing it due to my bad credit.   Since I was born every step of the way has be measured out.  1.  Graduate High School.  Okay, Check. 2. Graduate College. Mmmm, Check. 3. Get a job. Alright, Check. Alright, now what?  I did all that sooo..... I'm waiting........... what's the next step?   MarriageHouseChildDivorceRetirementDeath.   Great can't wait.

"This is the product of idle time. Usually phone support during queue time does not give us this much idle time, that is until you are one of two who have a direct customer service split. Then you get to sit around and do nothing but wait for one of two tiny lights to come on for you to answer the phone. Lucky for me this phenomenon does not happen very often on weekends. Therefore I am left here contemplating the future, browsing for new platform games, twiddling my thumbs, and feeling a little guilty because the rest of my team is busy taking calls. Not that I really mind the rest, but you kind of wish everybody else was resting with you. Right now I really wish I were home already inflicting pain upon my thumb by pushing on a little analog stick on my PS 2 but then again I come in and work all night so I can pay for my little electronic addiction. Of course I think I'm rambling now because I really just don't have that much to do, so if this were a piece in English class I would probably flunk because of the lack of coherence in this post. Then again since its not then I think I'll ramble on, that is if I get to think of anything more to ramble about. Hmmm, the light came on interrupting my train of thought, but I'm back now. Now I'm wondering how I'm going to fund my CD habit. I really want to get my own copies of so many discs now I think I'm going to drive myself crazy thinking about where all my money went. After I get my credit card bill gets to me that is, but then again at least CD's are tangible and they happen to be mine.

I helped him cos I felt that he was true to mi and was a worthy  friend  to help but that was only a point of view of mi of a guy so i'm not sure about others (mostly the gals), I also donnoe about his past about his relationships wif other galfriends so I did't made much comments about him on tat.

"It was summer - the leather seats on my Granny's navy blue Cadillac were hot and sticky.  Going to the bank with Granny was a normal kind of errand for me and my little brother.  The First American Bank tellers were very kid-friendly; they always sent suckers for us kids when they sent back the money for Granny.  On this particular day, Granny had a telephone set in the floorboard of her car.  She was the queen of mail-order catalogs, and she had gotten this red telephone, with a red cord and handset, from one of the many catalogs that filled the end tables at her house.  The phone had big black touch tone buttons, and I was amusing myself by making lots of clicking noises as I ""dialed"" familiar numbers.  In 1987, my 8 year-old self was impressed by the thought of a phone in the car.  No one that I knew, like my parents, family or friends, owned a car phone.  As we rode down Nolensville Road, dialing those numbers made my imagination wander and soon the receiver found its way to my ear.  I became lost in a whirlwind of conversations.  Instantly, I became a wealthy young woman (since I had a ""car phone""), who was talking to famous people like country singer Reba McEntire or actor Patrick Swayze.  Patrick called me right as we pulled up to the teller at the bank.  Granny would have to get my sucker for me today - I was far too busy talking with Patrick about doing a movie next month to stop and wave at the smiling lady behind the glass.  I felt so important.  I rode around talking on my car phone for at least two weeks, until my brother pointed out that you could see the cord, and that made me look dumb.  He was just jealous that Reba didn't want him to come over and go swimming in her new heated swimming pool.

"I was having a relatively average Friday at work when I decided to step outside for a fresh dose of nicotine and a butt scratch. As I was revelling in the sensation of my fading itch I noticed a flock of geese flying overhead. Inevitably the lead goose (I like to refer to the leader as ""the big cheese"") was cut down by a nudist pole vaulting midget (sorry, ""small person"" [I really like the brackets today]). As the two came crashing to the ground in a whirling pile of blood, puss  ; soft white bird feces I had a rather embarrasing moment of my own. A horrid scent tickled my senses. It was the kind of scent one doesn't pick up from a big cheese and a small person colliding 40 feet in the air. No, this scent was a little closer to home. Only after I felt the squishiness between my lower cheeks did I realize what had taken place. Some form of monsterous human being must have stolen my pants right off my body while I was distracted by the mid air catastrophy. This foul being then made doo-doo in my brand new Tazmanian Devil boxers before carefully placing them back on my body. A change of shorts and a roll of toilet paper later I began my hunt for the elusive undergarment defiling creature. Armed with only a plastic fork and a half burnt cigarette I patrolled the nearby streets for nearly half an hour when it hit me. Perhaps some of the other lower to middle class working folk in the area had been violated by the underpants bandit. I went to my truck and grabbed my CSI kit I ordered off the net. It arrived last night, just in time for me to uncover the mystery of the soiled ginch. Unfortunately I was unable to find any evidence outside of my own underpants. There didn't seem to be any eye witnesses either. Maybe they had been paid off or were just too afraid to talk. The bandit must have got to them.

"My Japanese friends just got back from a visit to Toronto. They found the people there much more patient and easy to communicate with than here in Gainesville, FL. And Toronto is probably the most ""Americanized"" city in Canada. Another proof that Canadians are a more considerate breed.   But why is that all Canadians envy you when they find out you're in Florida? Most of them haven't lived here, that's why. Sure, 3x the sunshine is nice. No snow is good, too. But if you ask me, the most important thing about a place is the culture of the people. Eager Canadians who head south for the warm weather will gradually come to realize there's no place like home.

"Should Social Security be run by the government? Is government good at doing that sort of thing? When I attended a student meeting with one of the chair's of the Fed (in NYC) he said that there are two things that the US has to worry about economically in the future. The first is the trade deficit turning over and the second is the retirement of the baby boomers. Now I read your (MWS) post to Joe Crow about SS' funding till 2040 but the best estimates I can find (the only economist I can find who says otherwise is Paul Krugman from the NYTimes, so maybe I'm off base since he's a superb economist) state that under the pay-as-you-go system within a dozen years the retirement benefits mandated by current law will exceed SS payroll taxes. So we're talking about tax increases within our (or at least my) lifetime (Fortune article called it The $44 Trillion Abyss).  Now, as you mentioned earlier, any serious student of human nature has to look at the world realistically. When you put a social safety net (just like free health care) in place, what's gonna happen? It will be overused...that is human nature unless people are given a clever incentive to do otherwise (I leave wiggle room here in case I’m forced to recant later). People are going to plan on using it, not everybody, not all the time, but those guys on the margin of making a decision on savings will tend to take this retirement benefit into account and, god forbid, plan on it. The system is going to HAVE TO handle the stress from the poor and disabled AS WELL AS the free riders. Now, that's not say that SS is altogether bad, socializing some costs is important, but the pay-as-you-go system is totally ridiculous! You get one guy who knows about accounting and one guy who knows about demographics in a room together and they'll tell you something's got to give: either taxes go up or benefits go down or a little of both. Maybe another variant would work better, but the most libertarians I meet get annoyed when their children’s futures are being taxed away before their eyes.  Sorry about the length—I’m getting my own thoughts in order and I’m not as concise as I’d like.

"""When exactly do we go from being kids to being just people, I'm not sure. I do know that it's not about turning a certain age or graduating from school. It happens when you're not paying attention. We go from playing with our friends to playing with our friends' feelings. Without our knowledge or onsent, childhood slips away in the night and our innocence escapes us and we wake up one morning to find who we are.""      it makes no sense to me. this all seems so confusing. our parents tell us that we aren't doing what we're supposed to be doing and that we are going to ruin our lives if we do this or that, when in fact they did it themselves and they turned out just fine. there's a ton of people out there that do drugs. i know what they can do to you, i mean i work with people at the Baker's Treat who are trying to get over what they have done to themselves. it not news to me that you can get addicted and that its bad for you and what not. i no this seems weird for me to be talking about but i have a point.      as most people know, i live under a rock. i don't go out all that often and when i do, my mom has to know everyone that's going and has to make sure that all the parents know exactly what we are doing. it's craziness. tomorrow i turn 16...friday i get my permit...a year from friday i will have my license and will be able to go out whenever i want to...or atleast i should be able to do that...but knowing my mom, i wont be able to. i don't see y i cant go out and just do what i want to do without being questioned. i've never been to a concert because my mom thinks im gonna get raped. im not allowed to go to parks with my boyfriend because she thinks im gonna have sex in public...yea like that's gonna happen. i actually do have morals...lots of them. even though i have borken like half of them but that doesn't matter...my mom doesn't trust me or my friends. she's in for a rude awakening my senior year...and probably this year when my friends all get their licenses...      if my mom thinking im gonna go out and get high and drunk she is wrong...i might do that once or twice but that's it...haha..but i dont no...i probably wouldn't even do it...i just want to be trusted for once...

Just some numbers, and there she is, on the other end of the line, giving me good advice and comforting me. Francina is really the only comfort i find in this new school. I felt happy, glad to be her friend and know that i can always trust in her. *sigh* Today, she is going off to Holland. Passed me some of her books that are due by Friday before she left and i gave her a feather for good luck. I shall miss her when she is gone...I really hope for a better day tomorrow man...haiz...

I'm trying not to plunge into a sea of various results of hallucinogenics straight away, so instead I'm going to approach the problem of how I'm going to start this thing off... But I guess I already have !! Well, that was easy !!  I suppose I should introduce myself. Hi, I'm Laura. *shakes hand* I'm thirteen, and I live in a large town (or small city. But hey, the glass is half full) called Livingston, which is in Scotland, located near the capital. I was born on the 29th of September 1990, which makes me a Libra (the most utterly boring sign in the zodiac).  I go to a Catholic high school (St. Margarets R.C. Academy) which I like to refer to as ""The Convent."" I am, in fact, a baptised Catholic, although I wouldn't say that was my religion as I don't practice it (unless that couple of times that I picked up the Bible when I was in a 'contradicting everyone' mood counts...). Actually, you could say that me and God have some issues to work out. I suppose you could call me an Atheist, although I did mess about with Magik for a while...  This is like my seventh attempt at a diary, as I just seem to start them, get bored and then move on to start another one. But, as you are my diary, you are required to have a name (See? At least the Diary of Anne Frank inspired me in SOME way).  And you shall be called... Tai. I like that name, I got it off of Rhyan, who wants me to me called Tai when I become a transexual. Personally I'd rather be named Bert. That's a masculine name. I tried to look up Tai on a names and meanings website, to enlighten myself onh the wisdom behind it. This is my result:  Name: Tai Origin: Chinese Meaning: 'Very big'  ...That'll do me. *wink*  Hum. Isn't it ironic how I have just spent about an hour setting up this account and fixing my profile to look all nice, and when I start writing my first ever entry... I get writers block. Oh, speaking of irony, my friend Sian and I were in Bathgate on Monday, and as we were walking to the chippie an NHS van drove past us... and the driver was smoking.   ...Well this seems like a sufficient introduction, so I'm away laughing on a fast camel.

My friends known or I try to remind them that what i say that is mean is just kinding around, but thats different here with my family. To me it seems that know matter what i do or what i say i feel like I can never do anything right. I'm not trying to make it seem like my life is all bad or anyhting like that I have good times and bad times but for me it seems that the bad happens more often then the good.

"Ok everybody. I'm going to admit I'm  not the most unfortunate soul out there. And I feel bad. So I want all of us to start praying for Kellie's friend who just lost everything in a fire.   Psalm 23 A psalm of David. 1 The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not be in want.  2 He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters,  3 he restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. 4 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.  5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.  6 Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.  Wow I love that passage. Later

"I was sitting at dinner with a few of my friends, and the conversation turned (as it often does) to the war in Iraq. WWI, WWII, Vietnam? It was always the young men who were sent out to fight. Young men like me.  I don't want to fight. I don't want to die.  Has the world lost its senses?

"Howdy everyone,     I guess I have to find a way to write in this a bit more and keep things up to date however that is somthing I am not always good about. Now that summer is here maybe if there is any exciting news I will post some info and see what is going on in my life.    So now that school is done and I have one course down and I have been to Burlington and back I now enter July.  THe month of unchartered waters. Who knows what this month will bring for me.  I am sure I will have many adventures but at the same time I am sure I will be busy with all the free time I have to deal with.  Today I finished one of my first summer craft projects. I redid my fun chair.  Oh it was so much fun and now I have a very nice light green sponge painted chair.  I think I should just go into home decorating and photography.  I guess maybe if nothing else I will use this as a gauge of what I get done this summer.  Well I hope to get my puzzel I got started and done. I am working on ideas for my classroom. I get to work on bulletin board and decorating ideas. Oh the fun that is present in a summer off.    The 4th of July is here.. I think back to the two times I have not been in the US to celebrate the 4th. One year I was in Paris France at the Hard Rock Cafe and then 2nd time was this last year when I went to Australia for the Summer.  The 4th was the last day we spent in Port Douglass. We went out to Hog's Breath Cafe and had a blast with the bus driver.  OH the memories of July 4th past.  I also recall the year I went to my friends house and we had a hudge water fight and I got water dumped over my head.. Yeah many memories and I am sure more to be created yet this year.  Till next time keep on blogging and Happy 4th!  Cheers!

"Allright, I have a job again. I now am the secretary/customer service/first level tech at Lakeshore Computer Consulting, LLC and Midview Internet Services. My little brother is a tech there, so he got me the job. It's going allright, but the owner tends to swear a bit more than I am comfortable with. He kinda flies off the handle about really stupid shit, and has a tendency to make you feel like crap, so hopefully I'll just learn to let it go, and get used to it.

Big news of the day: today is the day my condo goes on the market. Yup, after over a year in glorious Chelmsford, I have decided to pack up and move back down to the Boston area. With the exception of Derek, all my friends live walking distance to the T and I count the number of times people have driven up to visit me on one hand. Ok, maybe 2, but definitely no toes! I guess I bought the place hoping to settle down there in the near future with my then beau, but things change and you need to accept that and move on, right? Hey, I may even make a profit off of it.

"When I think about everything you put me through and all the heart break you caused me, I wonder why I ever thought I loved you. And I wish I never knew the real truth.   You made me smile and frown, laugh and cry, you even made me happy when sad. Cheered me up every way, and even yet didnt stay. Why have I gone so far as to find the truth. Now I wonder how I let this pass me by without ever giving a good cry.   You never held me, never kissed me, never showed me how you felt. And yet deep down still always believed you. Until the day I woke up to find it not to be a dream, but all the heart break to be true.   You made me crash, then said so sorry. Broke me once, tiwce then once more again. You shoock me too me never to go back. Playing along with every little song, never thinking or caring how I would get over it.   Heart broekn, heart taken, heart never given back. I hit my head against the wall while I wonder what I ever did wrong to ruin what I thought we had, and about something I know I'll never get back.    I know you messed me up bad, but why do I feel like I'm still getting punished for your mistakes?!

"Today is the last day of my 4th of July vacation. Then it's back to school for one day, then I'm off again Thursday, then school Friday, off for the weekend, school for three days then off again for six days. I don't know why they schedule two big breaks so close to eachother, but that's YTI for you. I had a pretty decent 4th. Each year both sides of my family have a picnic. They're usually on separate days, but this year they were both on the same day. First we went to my second cousin Jim's house for what is traditionally known as the ""Shinndig"" (I am descended from the Shinn family). This is attended mostly by people who I either don't know or only see once a year at this event. Afterwards, Beth and I went canoeing at Camp Blue Diamond. I hadn't been to Blue Diamond in years, but my parents used to send me there for church camp when I was a kid so it conjured up a lot of memories of not wanting to be there. It's a lot more enjoyable when I can do my own thing instead of being forced to do this or that and sing a bunch of stupid songs. We paddled around the lake for a while, enjoying the serenity of nature....or something. Then it was off to my aunt Wanda's house for picnic #2 where we ate food and watched my uncle and cousin and a couple of kids from accross the road set off fireworks in the rain. Then we headed to my grandmother's house for a little while before going back to my parents'. Overall, it was a good day. Good times were had by all and Beth got to see some wildlife she's never seen before, like dragonflies and a vulture (or was it a buzzard? I don't know the difference). I don't know how you can live for 26 years and never see a dragonfly, but that's Beth. Well, that's it for now. Maybe I'll update this thing again sometime.

"Isn't it strange how well life is going perfect yuo never take time to thank God for everything that you have, but then the second you lose something you either blame it on God or beg him to give it back, or when you do have something you want u go to God and ask him to do it all for you. Isn't it strange how when u have alot of friends to talk to you dont care about the people who mean most to you, but then when you lose all your friends you try and turn back to the ones who care about you even though you ignored them and treated them like jerks. Isn't it strange that the things you seem to hate most in life are the things that will help your life, like doing math homework, or getting grounded for failing a science test that u didnt study for to begin with. Isn't it strange how sometimes your worst enemie becomes your best friend, and your best friends sometimes become your enemies. Isn't it strange how when someones so happy with the thing they have you start to get jealous insted of being happy for them, then start to want something just because someone else has it. Isn't this just all so strange?

"Well now that Kerry selected a running mate, the election will start heating up.  My support goes towards are current and great President.  However, I am a little worried about his chances.  Everywhere I turn I hear how so many people hate him, he is constantly getting bashed everywhere you go, and for some reason other than talk shows the GOP isn't fighting back.  This was the same mistake his dad made, and I think this election is too important to lose to someone who has yet to take a stand on any of the major issues (Hey Kerry we know you wouldn't have sent troops, but we are there now so what would you do now if you were in office?)

Well first let me tell you a bit about me and where I live... My name is Trevor Nederlof I'm 15 and I live in a town called Westport which is in connecticut. I have a younger brother (Andrew) who is 13 as well as a black lab (Chloe) who is 10. We just moved to a new house near a river which goes through our small sized town. I am a geek because I love computers but at the same time I have a strong love for sailing... every type of boat may it be 10-150 feet I have done it all and love every moment of it.                 Last night I saw Aliens Vs. Predator which was a great action movie and I recommend it to everyone. Then I woke up at 3am to watch my cousins boyfriend artor  row in the olympics on a 2 man boat. I was tired when I awoke at 8am I started to unpack my room and help my cousin Jake who works for my mom take alot of the boxes from our move to the dump in town. I met my best friend David Brenner  (Everyone calls him Brenner) in town and we rode on bikes back to my house where we watched Da Alie G Show which is the funniest show EVER. After Brenner left I basicly just played computer games while helping my aunt and grandmother with the boxes from the move. Well Pizza will be here soon so I should go...           Look forward everynight by 8pm est (1 am GMT) I will post on my blog and I hope you all share with others so they to can read my life lol. Until tomarrow enjoy life because you only live once :)

Seeing her again.  I did blow her off. But I have just given myself the time I needed to get my mind back in order. This one week crawled by.  Seemed like an eternity.  I woke up this morning.  A gagging noise, then a forced heave as I stared blankly at the ceiling.  Too scared to move.  Then a surryingoff and the patter of  little kitten feet.  I knew that my cat threw up on my damn bed. I slid my feet up, and boldly looked down.  Yes indeed, but not just a small pile, a stream across the whole quilt.  At least four feet long.  That was it.  I just got up. 6:30 AM.  Went downstairs and watched All in the Family recordings.  Damn funny show at times.    I am falling deeper and deeper in love with Sarah Vowell.  I learned a few days ago that she is an Athiest.  She is a Democrat.  She is my oasis in this world of unlogical happenings. She is so beautiful. I will marry her someday, I know it in the deepest parts of my soul. The sticky parts.

"Dear my bathroom mirror, I've been roaming around in the empty street.  Coming home to an empty room.  Talking to an empty wall.  And afraid filling an empty glass.   I've been weird these days.  and more to that i've been turning my face around way too much.  So much it leads me to this question.  I really hope you can answer.   ""what is movin on, dear friend?""   What is it really?  Is it driving twice faster everytime you pass those places that have THAT memories?   Is it turning the radio off soonest you hear those songs that scream THAT memories?  Is it turning your car around close to home, just because the thought of finding yourself alone in an empty room becomes an unbearable thought.    Is it forcing yourself to be around people as much as you can, no matter how it kills your inside, and how you feel much emptier in the more crowded places.   Is it burning all the objects that has anything to do with THAT memories.   Is it asking your boss to give you more assignement, so that you can bury yourself in it, no matter how tired you are already. Just so you dont have to think about THAT memories.   Is it finding yourself in the arms of randoms strangers, and finding yourself in the more strange rooms with strange smells, among huffings and puffings from these stranger whom language you cant even understand, only to avoid those feelings resemblance to THOSE memories.    Is it not letting your glass run out of vodkas in those bars, where you can forget how awkward it is to dance with an empty feelings, and then fill your frozen stare with more vodkas, so that the most you would care about is not to fall face first.   Is it logging off twice faster than the lightning whenever you see him go online.   Is it saying you're fine thousand times to yourself.   Is it finding yourself putting on more make up than what you used to do, just so that you dont look pale.   Is it turning your face around twice as much whenever you see any guys walking with blue checkered shirt and cargo pants.   Is it numbing your feelings. Is it freezing your inside.  Is it killing who you were before and becomes a whole lot of different person.   Or Is it leaving this island?   What is it dear friend?  --------------------------   I love myself. I deserve better. I am moving on.  I will be okay.  I have valium now.

"Question.   What is this blog about? why's it here? who the hell are you? and why do you think that this deserves to take up valuable internet real estate?   well i'll tell you grasshopper. this blog is a test, a personal test. a test designed to push my own boundaries, and maybe...just maybe bring into being something bigger than just another shitty internet blog.  ultimately, this blog will be a place where i can give wings to my voice and throw open the doors that hold back the whirlwind of emotions and thoughts that dance their way through my headspace. ambiguous enough for you?  on a specific note, i am hoping to eventually provide enough detail about my personality and ideas/ideals that at some point in the future my posts can be used to create a simulacrum of myself. some sort of personality that will capture the essence of what I am about. but that's more of a long term goal.  short term this blog will aim to provide myself with a sounding board for my own thoughts and emotions. a place where I can cry out to my imagined readers and tweak my opinions.  the title of the blog 'generation gap' reflects a deep emotional feeling that I have regarding being labeled by society, and falling down into the generation gap [or generation trap]. hopefully my rantings will address this give the site a 'feel' of changing for the better.  so who the hell am i? i am me! i am someone who is searching. someone who is constantly looking, not sure what he will find, but making the most of the journey of discovery. i am someone who is sick to death of the crap passed down to us by society, in an unconscious attempt to mold us and tell us how to be. i am someone who is trying to push my own boundaries to discover my own mettle and shine in whatever way i can. i am me.  as for why this site should exist, well simply put, cause i want it to. it represents an extention of my will into an infinate void [the interent] where there exists plenty of room for everyone to play. so if you run into this site and don't like it... don't read it, don't come back... sorted. this site exists for me, but if someone else benefits from it then fantastic!  next question.

"Now that it's the middle of July, and my best friend is in California for the entire month, and my computer doesn't have internet, I feel really strange. It's like lonely, but not necessarily bored. Last week I rented Prince of Persia: Sands of Time for my Gamecube, and even kept the game past its due date  to finish it, it was that good. So I'm not necessarily bored. Like tonight, for instance, I finished 'Lucky', by Eddie de Oliveira (he's cute). It was a really good book, and I'm glad I read it. However, now that the game is played, and the book is read, I seriously need something more to do. I hoped to have a job by now, but then, I had also hoped to be going on student exchange this autumn, but it's amazing how, no matter how hard you try, some plans just refuse to come to fruition. It's neurotic.

"I am addicted to blogs!  After reading my friend Beth and Cs's blog, I was intrigued...I had a site on diaryland, but after so much time of not logging in, it was dismanteled, so to say.  Anyway, on Cs's page she has blogs that she reads, and lists as favorites or something like that, so I clicked on a few, and became addicted.  How weird that I can get so excited about logging onto AOL to read about people's lives that I don't even know, and they don't even know that I exist!  Weird, if ya ask me, but nonetheless, I am creating my own in hopes of someone's enjoyment in reading about my somewhat boring, but exciting life, to others...Let us begin shall we?             Yesterday I went shopping, imagine that, me shopping..ha.  I got a dress for the rehersal dinner, an outfit for the bachelorette party and reception...If you don't know, I am in a wedding!!  How exciting...It's for my friend Jamie, a friend that I've known about 20 years...What a great girl she is.  Anyway, went to Wal*Mart afterwards, bought some fun stuff, I love that store, it always has cool little things around there...And of course, they always stare at me saying ""buy me, buy me"".  Well I was a good girl, bought some scrapping stuff, and some other d0-dads, and I was out of there.  I had today off, went and got my haircut and went into the store (work - CVS/Pharmacy) to see what was going on with the girls.  I am a manager there (well, shift supervisor t0 be exact, but in about a year I'll have my own store as the manager).  Anyway, that was about it, came home, ate dinner, talked to a few people, and scrapped for a few hours, I am working on something special, can't tell ya in case someone reads this, I don't want to spoil a surprise...It's getting kinda late, and I have an 11 hour work day tomorrow, so I am off to the bed.

With such an interesting plot, I was amazed at how utterly boring and clouded the novel became, the only reason this novel is still in print is because english teachers get hard-ons through mental masturbation trying to analyze this overly ambiguous work.""

"Well, all in all things are going well. Day two went well yesterday and I tried to report it to my journal on www.BFL101.com but it is down. Since Monday a.m. I've dropped 4 1/2 lbs of water weight (who's kidding who here - I KNOW it is water) but weight is weight and it feels good. I've eaten clean for two whole days (except for a nip of Brandy last night) and it feels terrific.  Yesterday I rode my bike indoors on the windtrainer for a whole 20 minutes! I can't wear my regular brace when I do that because it only gives my 90deg of movement, and I need about 115 to ride. So I wore the tensor, which seemed to be enough. And I iced it down after.  Today is a weights day. I will get going after I drop the kids off.  Kyle had a friend over yesterday and they spent hours on the computer going to funny links.

"they say the best things in life are free.  i am inclined to believe whoever ""they"" are, though it's more like i NEED to believe them.  i'm starting this blob as a means to chronicle my struggle with the green, i.e. marijuana, and to begin putting words and images to this struggle--and maybe find some like-minded folks out there who too find themselves slogging through life, highly functioning, gainfully employed, well liked and quite intelligent but with an insatiable love for pot.  it's a complicted process, to be sure. my relationship with this drug is the longest relationship i've had--just about 15 years now--and it's waxed and waned in it's intensity but it's always been there when i needed it, keeping me as distant and untouchable as i wanted or needed it too.  i've used it the way some use alcohol--as a means to loosen me up in crowds, or make life just that much more interesting.  i've used it to wake me up, to clean my house, to grocery shop, to plant a garden, walk the dog, surf the 'net, drive long distances.  what does a pot smoker look like?  there is no one face.  i am not a deadhead, i am not a fan of jam bands in particular, i have a master's degree in creative writing, i have held a directorship for five years, a committed relationship for seven, i am published, own my own home, my truck, my life. or maybe the latter is not correct. my life is owned by something else, and it's kind and green and comes in so many different and amazing strains.  how did i get here? is it worth the struggle to get out?  if i wasn't such a comparative (as in i am constantly comparing myself to others, holding up the mirror, measuring the lack) junkie, i wouldn't flail so much in the face of quitting, because i know so many others who seem to get along just fine with this particular substance, using it recreationally and not worrying about it.  i get angry.  nobody likes the word addict. it seems so mealy and ugly.  what does an addict look like?  does s/he look like me? would knowing make any difference? i know you're out there.  i know you hear me, you of the family of the green.

"I’ve started attending this yoga class at the Fitness Center on Wednesday nights. I figured it would be a good way to gain more flexibility & strength. I have to admit, it’s a lot harder than I anticipated and that kinda pisses me off! Here I thought it would be a nice “break” from my regular workout routine in the middle of the week. I'm pretty flexible and since it’s not straight-up cardio, I assumed it would be easy.  Not so much. It’s actually pretty challenging to continually switch  ; hold all of those poses. And it turns out I’m not as flexible as I thought I was. I’m particularly horrible at the balancing portion of the class. I look like I stopped off somewhere for happy hour before showing up. However, I do enjoy the challenge so I plan to keep going. I just know it will take some time before I feel any sort of euphoria from it.

I'd like you to go and visit my website which resides at:  urlLink Bunni's Place    It's not quite finished, because my significant other hasn't finished providing me with his significant content for his part of the site. But the rest is done, or at least done enough that it might be considered enjoyable rather than annoying. Then again some people are annoyed by almost everything enjoyable. One can't make everyone happy.   I decided that a Blog might be a nice addition as I need a place to whine without having to upload a new whiners page to my site. Not that I will always whine here, but since I have the opportunity, I suppose I could. I could also leave the page absolutely blank, and make people wonder what I was up to. Well maybe just my paranoid visitors. Most people probably wouldn't care.   There's that word probably. Chances are, you will not see that word typed on a page of mine often. Since my earliest bbs days I have cut that word down to prolly, and it's become part of my speech. I avoid saying LOL during a conversation however. I actually do laugh out loud.   Well enough of this banter, because there's prolly gonna be more to follow.   I'd love to know how you like the website, and I'd be pleased to share comments and criticism right here in an open forum if you'd like.   Thanks for reading!   bunni

"I'm trying to understand a couple of things of wildly different importance.  First post is baseball.  Major League Baseball's insistence that their All-Star game decide which league receives the privelege of home field advantage in the World Series is ridiculous.  This policy blows my mind.  There are so many inequities in allowing a collection of individuals from different teams to come together and decide an important post-season rule such as home field advantage.  First of all, as evidenced by last night's debacle, one person's failure can crush an entire league's hopes.  Roger Clemens comes in and lays an egg and the next thing you know the National League doesn't have a chance.  This year's example is particularly strange, since A.L. batters came into the game with the luxury of having faced Clemens multiple times—something most N.L. hitters could not say about their encounter with Mark Mulder to start the game.  Also, because of MLB's insistence that at least one player from each team be represented, players with no real vested interest in which league gets home field advantage are deciding the outcome.  I doubt Livan Hernandez is particularly concerned with the post-season this year.  So if he faces someone like Derek Jeter, the stakes are unequal to the point of unfairness.  Another thing about all of the ""This Time it Counts"" garbage is the fact that the game is still played like an exhibition.  If the game is really supposed to count, then I want Barry Bonds in for the whole game.  I don't want Roger Clemens pitching on a couple hours of sleep because of all of his All-Star festivity obligations.  I want Mike Piazza, not Johnny Estrada (no offense to the promising young catcher), trying to make up a 5-run deficit.  I mean, I'm a Cubs fan.  They have a chance to play in the World Series and it makes a huge difference to the club and fans alike whether more games are played at Wrigley Field.  But that point is moot because the All-Star game is supposed to be an exhibition.  What would be the point of naming Estrada as an All-Star if he didn't get a chance to play.  It's all just stupid.  It's an idea that never should have been let out of the think tank.  Baseball should take a page from the NBA and NFL.  The team with the best regular season record gets home field advantage...it's pretty simple, really.

"Well I think I know what my problem is. I'm not opinionated enough to own a blog. I'm totally indifferent about almost everything, so I can never think of anything to write.  Maybe I'll just write about what I did last night. Ben and I went to the park with his aunt, uncle, and cousins to watch a Tongan brass band play. We ate chicken from Sugarhouse Barbecue and it was so yummy. I don't know what their secret is, but their chicken tastes just like camping. Then the plan was to go back to the cousins' house to have brownies and ice cream and play Halo, so I asked to be dropped off at home because I didn't want to stay up all night. Plus I don't enjoy video games very often. Well they opted out of playing Halo because they wanted me to come have ice cream with them, so I went, even though I hate it when people change their plans for me. It makes me feel whimpy. So anyway, you might think that means we got home at a reasonable hour, but we still ended up staying there until midnight. I don't know how those guys (Ben's cousins/aunt/uncle) can stay up so late all of the time and still get up at 6:30 to go to work. It's hard for me! For some reason, as soon as I graduated from college, I turned into an old fart who has to go to bed on time. Totally lame.  Well it looks like I have a little bit of an opinion after all...at least about people changing their plans for me and going to bed on time. Who knew?

"I was traumatized today.      It was horrible.       Mom let me outside to play. I was having a grand old time. I teased the hamsters in their cage. The little balls of fluff just hate it when I paw the bars. They puff up and jab at me. Little buggers have a heck of a bite when the catch ya though.      When that got boring I spent a little time hunting bugs, though I have be careful to stay away from the rock garden and the flowers that attract the best bugs.      After my belly was full I started my rounds and was on the far side of the house when I was suddenly soaked. Rain came out of nowhere and I just got drenched. I had to sit and cry at the back door screen for five whole minutes before mom let me in so I could dry off in my bed.      I am still a little damp. I am not sure I will recover anytime soon.      I heard mom say that it is supposed to rain all week. I think I will stay inside, no matter how much I crave a good crunchy bug.

"Hi, I'm Gabe's mom, Chrissi. Gabe [aka, Gabriel, bird, goo, goober] is my six month old son. He is a gorgeous little boy, he likes to eat, play, pull the cats' ears, coo, laugh, and nap with his daddy. Gabe also has spina bifida and hydrocephelus (sp?). It was quite a shock to learn that he had spina bifida. We went in for our 20 week check-up and everything was very normal. We found out he was a little boy and that he was growing well. At 28 weeks, i developed diabetes, that sucked, so we asked the doctor to do another ultrasound to make sure gabe wasn't getting too big, that was when we found out that his spine hadn't closed all of the way and that the ventricles in his brain were a little bit larger than they should be. Talk about overwhelmed, disoriented, and generally confused, we had no clue what the hell spina bifida was, let alone how we were going to deal with it! At 37 weeks, Gabriel was delivered by a wonderful team of doctors and rushed to the NICU to be prepped for surgery. For almost 2 weeks we couldn't hold him, nor could I breast feed, snuggle, or be very close to him. I think that the worst part was going home without him. He stayed in the hospital for 16 days. He had a shunt placed in his head when he was 14 days old. My husband was freaking out over the shunt, after all, they had to put it in his brain! Everything worked out fine, and he came home with us and we have been living pretty happily ever after. Ok, not quite, reality has a funny way of making the whole, ""oh look we have a cute little baby in the house, isn't this fun??"" be a little more like, ""holy shit, i never sleep, i've worn the same clothes for 3 days, and i smell!!!"" on top of this, we are dealing with a child who has to see special doctors, an hour away, i might add, and we are continually worrying about something going wrong.  The special doctors are still a reality, but we don't see them very often now, only about once every 3 weeks. Now at 6 months, gabe is a pretty normal baby. i am back to work at the Montessori school I teach at, and gabe comes with me. He loves all of my kids and they love him back. We are blessed that Gabe has a ""low level"" case of spina bifida, which means, he has bladder and bowel control, he will walk, and most people won't even realize has a birth defect! It still sucks, though....

"it's really sad when God takes away a life... especially when it's someone close to you.. especially when it's too soon.. like you wish that you could've spent more time with that person. you never realized how much they meant to you until they're gone. i guess it's part of life, to teach us how precious life is and how we shouldn't take it for granted. just came back from krish's cremation.. krish was this guy in my grade... never knew him well, since i only met him this year, but he was the first guy to talk to me at ASB. i still remember the first day, on the bus, he was like, ""hi!.. you're in 10th grade too?.. i'm a new student..."" and after that simple gesture, we started talking... when we arrived at school we didn't know where to go, so he was all, ""let's just go together... :)"" and after we found our own groups of friends, we sort of drifted awei... i regret it though.. i wish i could've learned more about him rather than shun him away. i never even knew the little details about him, like about his family or his past... i guess i learned that we shouldnt take anyone for granted.. coz tomorrow they might be gone just like that. the cremation was held in this Wat in Soi Ekkamai.. i've never been in a thai-style funeral, but it was pretty much the same... almost everyone at ASB was there.. not to mention all his old friends in NIST, RIS, ISB... there were about 500 + people!!!... and almost everyone was crying (including me.. hehe!)!... it just goes to show how much he touched everyone's lives in different levels... when they cremated him, they put inside his possessions, like a soccer ball and his favorite shoes, his cell and some cards and letters we made... and then they played ""i'll be missing you"" by p.diddy and faith evans... :( i'm gonna be thinkin of him every time i hear that song!!!  RIP Prishant Johri (Krish) December 25, 1986-February 13, 2004 Born on the 25th of December, the day of our Lord. Died on Friday the 13th, the day of bad luck.

He is saying that I keep calling and bugging him, but I'm not. You didn't here the things that he said to me and you don't know the way he made me feel. He was my good friend, He could tell me anything, problems with his girlfriend or school, I could also tell him anything, I thought that I could trust him. I was wrong. He told you lies so that way he could be cool and I would be a fool. So this is how I feel. Right now I'm not thinking about what we could have had, Because you are not worth it. Why would I want someone who tells lies? Why would I want someone that can't respect me? You might ask why I am saying all of this if I think your not worth it, But the truth is I don't know either,  I guess that's just how I feel! -Chelsea

"Of course the first week went by... not juz wnet by but with events that made me realised that teaching is no longer teaching.  Firstly, 34 periods as a begining teacher. Really heavy. More than double when compared to my practicum dayz. But i took it in a good stride. I took it more of a challenge and I have to live up to it.  What I am even more surprised is that, I have to work more than 15 hrs a day. Is this crasy or what. The first week, the only day that I managed to leave sch early was on fri, which was to go for fridy prayers. This is because on the 30 and 1 of July, there were induction programmes for the new teahcers. Thus I was not able to prepare lessons for my coming day and I have to continue work at work at home till 12in night. This cycle stated on tues 29 of june where the teahcers had a contact time. Thus my work load on tues was carried on to wed and wed to thurs and thurs to fri. I feel unfair to my students because I personally think I could have prepared a more interesting lessons for them.  But then again when i think abt it, the induction programme could have been carried out much ealier or during the holidays when we came back for the workshop where the entire induction programme could be squeeze into one day.  While, I enjoyed my classes. I love to go to class and present my lessons and see the kids literally grwo in terms of their knowlege and moral development. Thus I realised why there is a high percentage of teachers leaveing the work force because teaching is no longer teaching. There are lots of admin stuff which begining teacher like me have to managed.   Fortunately I have a very helpful department which keep in me check with the stuff that is going ard in the school, like booking of the AVA room or the computer lab. Despite all the heavy first week, I look many new things which have kept my teahcing passion alive. One of them is the love for the students. Seeing the ability to see them grow is something I feel no amount of money can buy.  I guess i need more time to get mysekf acustome to the sch policy and work culture. We see how it goes in the second week then. Till then.. signing out wery and still hopeful.....  Begining Teacher in AMKSS

"I just finished reading G.K. Chesterton's ""The man who was Thursday"" on sunday.  I think it is possibly among the more thought stirring books I have ever read, especially the following lines ""When I saw him from the back, I was convinced he was a devil.  But when I saw his face, I knew he was a God.""  It was one of the more powerful lines of the novel, and I won't tell you much more because I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it yet.  I think the most amazing books I have ever read (outside of the Bible) have been mainly fiction ones, that touched my heart rather than the philosophical ones that expanded my mind.  It is quite surprising that these novels are so dear to me considering my own overly cerebral nature.  Ravenheart by David Gemmel, has probably done more for me than Ethics, by Aristotle.  What kind of books are the ones that have made you change your thinking?  Josh

"Some days I feel so bloody old. It's the way I remenisce over old times and experiences I had when I was younger. And I think it's the fact that I do this so oftern is what makes me feel like a bit of a dinosaur. Maybe I'm being overly aware of the changes that have occurred over the last few years. I'm 26 and that's really nothing in the scheme of things. But I had such a crazy time from 16-22, 23 that I can't help but sometimes feel in awe of the times I've had.  I imagine alot of us go through it but I seem to be the only who keeps talking about it.  I think I'm a narcissist. I think I think about what I think about way too much. Am I overly concerned with the way I perceive myself? Why do I always have to feel ""good"" about every situation. Even when I'm with a person, when we part I always feel the need to make the parting ""smooth and clean"".  No awkward goodbyes and whatnot. But then I think that because I'm already anticipating the situation that makes it awkward. Anybody else ever feel like that?  Why do I always have to find the things that I think are wrong with me and then make a strategy of how I""m going to combat and resolve those inequities? How good it would feel to say: I'm selfish, I smoke too much pot, I'm cheap, I always need things to be 'even'  AND THAT'S HOW I AM. DONE. No plan, no outline to correct my traits gone awry. I bet people live like that. It must be fucking great! And very freeing....  We took grandma out for lunch today to celebrate her 78th birthday. I wrote on her card: P.S. You don't look a day over 50!!  I thought it was rather clever and tongue in cheek for a variety of reasons. In fact I thought it funner to say 50 as opposed to 20 seeing as 20 is such a stretch it's not conceivable. Either way i don't think grandma got it. ""oh, we better not let anyone see this"" was her response. Shit, then I felt like an asshole and even when were at lunch I kept thinking about how uncool it was, and I couldn't shake the feeling that everything wasn't perfect and smooth. Aya.  Gram gave me a slew of goodies, and I've finally got something from the family to hold onto. Thank God

"Super Smash Bros. Melee is my most favorite game in the world. It is a four-player fighting game that has super simple moves compared to other fighting games. However, don't think that it is an easy game to beat and no fun to play. You still must master moves for a character just like you would for any other fighting game. You have to know when to sidestep dodge, jump, and attack your opponent. You have to know when to roll behind and when to retreat. Only true master can beat Giga Bowser and the Master and Crazy hand!  Not only do you have to beat Classic, Adventure, and All-Star mode, you also have to beat all the event matches and get all 290 trophies! This is a must have for any Gamecube owner, and that means YOU! Buy it now! I am saying this out of my own love towards the game, and I am not a walking advertiser :)  Recently, there was a Melee Tournament in our area, and out of two and a half pages worth of people, guess who came out first...ME! I got hoards of stuff! I love being the best at Melee! Surprisingly, they never got me down to one life! It consisted of many three life stock battles. I brought my memory card and they let me use it because they had NO characters. I have 100 percent beaten that game.  Also, I have kept a profile name. It has over 1000 wins and around fifty losses. No, I play my brothers and Level 9 CPUs. I stopped the playing timer at 9,999:59! That's around 163 hours, and I know that I played more than that! I am a freak of this game and have emailed Nintendo multiple times on when the next Super Smash will come, but they said there has been none announced. If you know PLEASE TELL ME. I hope the DS will have the game. Just think... PORTABLE SUPER SMASH!!!  If you think you can beat me in Melee, I think I can beat you. You may not be easy, but I'm trying to become the best in the world! Come talk to me If YOU LOVE SUPER SMASH BROS. MELEE!!!!  I also have the original Super Smash Bros., but I think it's nothing compared to Melee. All you have to do in that game is throw. It's fake, but I still like it. You can talk to me about that too.  Dr. Mario is cheap!

"The day started like any normal day. Spent quality time with cow shit in the morning and then came home. But when I came home, I had the pleasure of trying to inform the soccer team of our game in De Pere that evening. That was an adventure. Called 10 people, left messages by all but 3. We ended up cancelling it anyway, thank God. So instead I went in my yard and kicked a ball around for a while just to pass the time because the Brewers are in the midst of a horrendous offense stretch. I actually caught Adult Swim tonight. Family Guy, Futurama, and Aqua Teen Hunger Force were all of good quality. So until something interesting happens, everyone who reads this will be forced to be as bored as me. But I'm assuming it'll only be Bob. Sorry Bob. I'll try harder tomorrow. Bacon out.

I'd rather sit here and draw, listening to Red Hot Chili Peppers. I'm kind of mad because I found out that I'm not in govenor honors this year for art because I'm not able to take 1st semester art class due to me failing 1st semester biology last year and I have to take it again. i hope that made sense. Being a small sophmore really sucks because then i feel like people think I'm a freshman and being in biology again doesn't help. I can't wait til I get this school year over with. I have a feeling it's just not going to be good. Homecoming is early this year! and i don't have a date yet. Usually I would have a boyfriend to go with, but at the moment I'm single. I have like 4 guys in mind too.... but I really doubt I'd be able to go with them. I want the guy to ask me too... and i don't want to go to homecoming alone. :sigh: I'm just going to pray about everything and see where God leads me.

"Well... I am unsure how to start this new blogging stuff...guess I will just reflect a little and see how it goes.  Have you ever been stuck in a matrix? I have! To me it was like being in a padded, suspended time warp during the early part of  my adult life. A time that lasted over 12 years. That shouldn’t happen to anyone...and shouldn’t have happen to me. But it did. I was 23 , a new single mom...no friends...no job...and not much family to speak of. I had to make money and take care of my son... I couldn’t afford to live on my own so me and my child stayed with my parents... I went back to school and learned a vocation. Then... tried for years and years to make a difference...be somebody and amount to something for my sons sake...the matrix I was in got thicker and harder to escape from...I couldn’t do enough for anyone. My parents, my employer, so called friends, relatives.... it was like total non-acceptance...I felt laughed at and demeaned.  (Like a RedHeaded Step Child.)  I had a vision of the way I wanted my life and it wasn’t happening. Feeling like every move I made no matter how positive only enabled those around me to throw dirt on my emotions and aspirations and even me. They would throw dirt on me! Spreading slanderous rumor making ugly innuendo... I would try and try to ignore and endure.  Oh!Gaud; How did I get there?  So much time had gone by in this continuum...my ideas were lost. Buried in the gook and gum of this matrix intra-cellular structure...  I got really  mad  one day and more or less threw my hands up in despare...then... feeling terribly,terribly  angry ... I suddenly broke free from the matrix by desiding right then and there ...That I was going to make a move. A move that would  change  my life and those that went with me for the better.  The  anger  did it...I was fed up...I had gotten to the point where I hated everyone around me...I had to get out or die trying...  It took alot out of me. It was a draining yet somehow refreshing experience.... In a way I was reborn...a new beginning... a time to be  me  and a very liberating change...  I had escaped.... It was my Independance Day...

"Elizabeth and I took a tube from Morden to Aldgate East. Had a marvelous vergetable curry with the most fragrant rice I have ever had.  Not bad for 8 quid for both of us. Now this was like entering a foreign country.  In the middle of London and even THE GRAFITTI WAS IN ARABIC.  Wow.... Birgitte joined us after several calls on cell phones : Where are you....I can't SEE you  (well no, we we trying on shoes INSIDE a shop).  Shopper Unanimous reunited.  I was soooo proud of myself, walked through a whole market and entered three shops without getting out credit cards or cash.  Nothing I fancied, that helped.  Instead I spend my birthday money on my friends.  Found the Graduate Art exhibition spread out over the whole old Truman Brewery site.  Fantastic stuff there.  Goldsmith was easy to find (thank you Adam for telling me they would be there).  One particular college we found by mistake got 1st prize from me : one guy had build a totally pointless contraption and when I asked him WHY he answered 'Cos is it pointless'.  I LOVE IT.  He  now wants to add on to it but can't because he has run out of space at home.  Ultimate stress beater.    Never found the Surrey lot :-(  Definitely going to the next one.  Legs are knackered, tomorrow I will pay the very very painful price.  Was it worth it...oh yes.  God bless.  J

"I could only admire you from afar    Can never tell how I trully feel    I'd rather be silent, alone    Than to lose you forever                       Since I was in the early stages of my maturity, I have long searched for someone who would care for me. Often disturbed by the sight of have found themselves intimately, I strived to obtain a personal connection of my own. Because of the envy that consumed me at the time, I rushed blindlessly into the raging sea of affection. Not knowing the consequences it would have. And so it has engulfed me in its massive whirlpools of chance. Eventually, it drowned me in great depression as each opportunity failed.  I was lost, confused, and even desperate. But soon I’ve found out the irrepressible truth… that nobody could ever learn to love someone as hideous as me. Society, the same one who offered all ideas of emotional optimism, has created these conformities that forever embody sentimental cynicism and hypocrisy.  As said in a movie, “Stripes for stripes… Spots for spots”  She’s a stripe. I’m a spot. …We could never be.  Maybe I’m paranoid. Maybe I’m delusional. Or maybe I’m right.  I have grown much, learned many things and known much about myself as an individual, as well as my emotional capacities to handle situations. But no matter how much I’ve developed, it will never please people.  A handsome face, a hot muscular physique, a nice sports car, wild sex - these are just a few things most people look for in a relationship.  Is she one of these people - people who look for the real essence of being together when they are not content with their partner or they have not sufficed there bodily appetites.  I’ve only met her for a few months. We have spent little time together and I’m still learning. Yet, my knowledge about her seems limited, thus disabling my abilities to fully please her.  … … … This is hopeless!  I am paranoid! I do not know how and I’m constantly afraid of the consequences my actions can bring.  I am delusional! I’m hoping she will be with me as time grows and old and weary.  Alas, I am right! I have no chance to at all…  So I worship you from a corner, wanting to tell you what I really feel about you. However, the thought of losing you weakens me even more.     I’d rather sleep tonight crying Id rather be empty inside I’d rather be soulless Than not see you again

"OMG it is so hot and humid! Today was this || close to being absolutely horrible, but there was one saving grace, and I'll save that for the end of this post. So, today I realized the full extent of the work I have to do (and should be doing now, but its too fucking HOT to stay focused) and have not done. All of my classes where boring as hell, History was the usual blend of note taking and sitting around with nothing to do, but today it was like a sauna (this is not good). I skipped Chem. to go have lunch with Tegan, which was really fun ;-), this would be the saving grace I mentioned. After finally saying ""bye"" to her *sigh*, I booked it back to Elmira to make it to class only about 5 min late for Physics. Again it was like a sauna in that class, even with the windows open, and we watched a movie and worked on the project I left at home in my rush to meet Tegan on time. So effectively did nothing. English was the same except the whole class didn't do any work, even Mr. Miessner didn't seem like he wanted to do work so he just let us talk all class. That class was productive, gossip wise, because I found out some interesting things about Chadder's ex. which I found quite funny.  Verdict: day as a whole sucked serious ass, but there where a few good times (thanks Tegan)

"Geuss what? I just realised how great I am at reviewing movies. Remember when I saw that one about the British ravers who contacted the undead via an Oujia [I've never had to spell that word] board? The one about the kids who snorted coke [cocaine, for those of you who aren't Ma-, er, down with the street speak] off train tracks when, wait for it, A TRAIN WAS COMING?  I also liked how they had sex, and the girl's shirt was on inside out for the rest of the film. Oh, but I wish I had seen all of it. Obviously, something that starts off like that must have a grand finale. But my mum wrestled the remote off me with a stern ""No more tacky B-grade films about British punks!""  But they weren't punks, mum. They were ravers.  The whole experiance left me hungary for more B-grade films. The 'B' in 'B- grade' stands for 'Brilliant', right? Oh, good. Anyway- Blurred.   IT HAD EVERYTHING.  A deformed freak who picked up hitchikers, playing a recording of a woman having multiple orgasms, in his wagon of death?  Hillbillies eating lasange?  Threesomes in a limo? The driver wearing a cocktail dress?  A stripper-hating nerd who fails to find true love?  Some ugly bitch who picked up an even uglier bitch [male, this time] and attempts sex with him? Several times?  Gothic girls on acid?  One of those great endings where they freeze on the face of each character and the text at the bottom of the screen tells you what happened to them after ""schoolies""?  IT. HAD. EVERYTHING. Am I one to be sarcastic? Exactly. See this film. Or the first one I raved about. Hahaha -RAVED.  Until the next time I go wild at the video store...

"I am so happy to have today off work.  By the time work  was over yesterday, I  felt emotionally spent. The women I work with  are such ""bitches"" well at least most of them. I was told how  yesterday morning I  was the main topic of  conversation on the  first floor, I  guess it  pisses  some people off because  I am paid  from the  moment I clock in, I guess they  don't  realize  that I  go right to work, I  dont  stand  around  for  10-15 minutes and gossip. I am pretty  quiet for the most part at work because I don't want to be a part of  the  junior high games  that  go on there, but  I  will say I   truely love my job and I refuse to let the  38-50 year old  crowd  ruin it  for me. I  do  have  one  very close  friend I work  with ""Julie"", we  have a deep connection, much deeper than anyone  there is  aware of,  we  can  talk about anything and even if we  don't  agree on something, thats  okay. I have shared many of my  life's secrets with her and she  doesnt judge me, it is so nice to have  a special friend like that!  Enough about my work life. Today I  took a vacation day because  I am  taking my children to register for  school. They will get their  schedules, order yearbooks, and get school pictures done. My  daughter is  especially  excited  because  she has  lost  55lbs and looks  terrific, that  along  with   getting contact lens's really has  boosted  her self esteem. Tonight I have to take her to  9th grade orientation and she  cant  wait to  see the  expressions of  peoples faces. My  son is kind of  excited about  going back to school, he anticipates  wrestling  season, and this will also  be the  first year since  middle  school he  will not participate in band.

I had to go visit California and Oregon and spend time with Dad instead of being smart and getting a start on my life.   So here I am.  Ready to be me.  Ready to be someone.  Ready to start and finish.  Ready to be done.  Ready to be...what?  What am I trying to be?  Senior year of college.  Criminal Justice major.  I could go to law school.  I could try to become a police officer.  I could just give up this joke and be a social worker.  I guess I'm ready for any of the options.  I have an LSAT score.  I can't get into the school I want with it but I can try again.  Do I want to try again?  Who are these people?  Who are my friends?  Beth thinks we'll go to law school together and be all happy go lucky.  I'm not like Beth.  She's outgoing.  She's a free spirit.  She's ready to be single and alone for three years just to get that freaking degree.  I want something more.  I want to find someone to be happy with.  Then maybe I can be happy with me.  And there's Mike.  What the hell are we anymore?  I know you will read this Mike.  So why don't you tell me what we are?  Just tell me if it's a yes or it's a no because I can't live in limbo like this.  You love me.  You don't want to marry me.  You think I'm sweet.  You think we're good together.  You don't know if you'd be happy with someone else.  What the hell?  But classes start again.  And I'll try some more.  Perhaps this will give me the outlet I need to just be me.  To figure it out.

"God!! If I could go back in time I would go to a sperm bank instead of having to deal with a dumb$$ baby daddy! well at one point he was my husband but now he has the title of baby daddy if I could call him that! Some men are so worthless that they make some women turn lesbians! I have tried in every way to deal with him and nothing! I tried been nice, getting angry and basically not giving a f***! and nothing! I get no emotion from him but some how everything is my fault! and I guess he is right, cause its my fault I got involved with him sorry a$$! The only thing that upsets me now is that my son is growning up with out a dad! Financially we don't need him cause I have a good job, but a child always need his two parents and when one is out, well there is only soo much the other parent can do. And sad to say that I know I'm not the only women dealing with a sorry baby daddy and the thing is that he isn't hurting me but he is hurting someone he created and has his same blood, his SON!! Maybe us as women are more connected with our emotions and I couldn't picture not seeing my son for months and men just go on with their life without a care about it! Clubbing and living the single life when we have to stay home and be responsible mothers and take care of our kids with double responsibilities cause while they are out creating more babies! All I know is that I'm doing the best I can and my son will know that I gave him everything he needed...and he will also know that his dad choose not to participate in his life....and as for his dad, well---- PAYBACK IS A B****!!!! ONE DAY HE WILL GET HIS!

I was going to go watch a movie, Spiderman 2 today with friends, so got up around 8:30am today and started my cleaing early so i wouldn't have to worry about it later in the day and can get ready for the movies too. So i walked toward my room and this dumb crate was in my way and i stubbed my baby toe on the crate and part of my toe nail came off and i broke it, eerrr! It seems as though bad things only happen to me, oh well. But all day i was in freak'n pain and didn't think much about it untill the sharp pain started getting worse and worse through out the day. So now im on pain killers that are making me feel so weird and in a twilight zone it seems like, that i've been trying to sleep through out the whole day to get my mind off the pain. I even tried to watch BarberShop 2 which didn't work b/c my mind was defiantly on my pain. I thought that i can really take pain but i thought wrong lol.

"Hello world!   Yes, well... umm... I've just started this journal, as you could probably tell, and I'm aiming to use it to record life as it is now for me. As for most journals, I haven't put this online to 'show it off' per say- I'm using Blogger because it's very accessible and so I can come back to memories and thoughts that I might well have forgotten in years to come. However, comments and everything are very welcome!   I hope that I'll be welcomed here well enough- I'm currently working on a layout of some kind that might come sooner or later... We'll have to wait and see!   Well, I suppose that first journal entries include a bit about the journaler, so I'll introduce myself, shall I? My name is Jennifer, but on the internet I go by the alias of Myth, I'm currently 16 and studying in 11th grade at a school in Brisbane, Australia. I'm more of a nerd than not, I guess you can say, but that's mainly because I need to study really hard to get where I want in life (in terms of a career) as I would like to become a physiotherapist, but I'm quite good at a variety of different things- I can write stories and poetry, draw to some extent and even defend myself, as I learn a martial art called  Ju Jitsu . My parents are separated, but I see them both equally, so it isn't that bad a deal, and I have two brothers- one twin brother and one half brother, who's currently six. He (the latter) is really cute, but he's also terribly annoying and (in m opinion) a little spoilt.   I like to RP (RolePlay), mainly the online kind, so you can often find me in the RP sections of forums, or MUSHing on sites like  Elendor , but most of my time is lately spent in study or at Ju Jitsu training, which is really very fun, despite all the bruises.   Well, that's about all I can think of at the moment, so I'll be off and I'll post sometime later! I plan to try a very different style of journal writing, so I'll see what I can come up with!

"Welcome to my ""Hello World"" post!  I am on a mission!  My wife, whom I couldn't love more if I tried, has had the wonderful luck of having her job relocate us to Orlando Florida!!  YEEEAAAHHHH!    We love Disney World and have been at least twice a year since we were married back in 1991.  We most recently took the Disney cruise and absolutely loved every minute of it.  We have two kids, a boy who is 9 and a girl who is 7, and they both love Disney World as well.  So you can imagine our elation at getting to move to Orland!  Then reality struck us!!  My job doesn't have an office in Florida!  Oh no!  There is no way we could move if I didn't have a job to move down there to (we currently live in Indianapolis IN).  Well I work as an IT Manager/Project Manager so I thought I'd just hit MONSTER and DICE and bingo, the job offers would roll in!  WRONG!  After applying to over 30 job postings I haven't had a single reply of interest.  Ok so the first thing I did was get introspective.  Is it me?  Am I not employable in the year 2004?  Then I thought it was my resume, so I had a professional help me out with that.  He polished it to a fine sheen and I resubmitted it to DICE and MONSTER.  Guess what!!  STILL no hits!  I spoke to a recruiter in Florida who has assured me that I will NOT get any hits because I do not live in Florida!  WHAT!  I'm not even asking for relocation fees!  My wifes job has that covered.  This is so frustrating that I just have to share this with the rest of the world, or whoever reads this that is!  If you are reading this and you can help me, please do and God bless you!  You can contact me at goofybk@insightbb.com.  Even if you can't help me, feel free to email me and we can chat about this frustrating topic.  Can I be the only person looking to move to Florida who is experiencing this?  Please at least let me know that I am not alone here!  I will be posting daily so look for more tomorrow!  I'll close with a little Disney Magic -  ""When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are, you'll never get a job in Florida, if you don't live there!""""  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

"Well, I've never done a ""blog"" before so you'll have to grade me on a curve.  Today was another fun visit to the dentist.  Turns out, that tooth #27 (yes, it's that specific) needed a root canal.  To really be able to focus on that particular tooth, my dentist found it neccesary to use a dental dam.  All I could think of was sex ed. in high school talking about dental dams for oral sex.  If anyone I was with pulled out a dental dam, I wouldn't be able to run away fast enough.  My day was quite uneventful otherwise. Other news:  I am missing someone that is very important in my life. Recently, I had to ""restrict"" a friendship with someone I care deeply about because her fiance isn't such a big fan of me.  It really sucks but I know that things will work out for the best and that nothing is impossible :) Until next time, God bless and good night.

"Through time all the conflict in society essentially boils down to either greed, power,  or a difference in opinions otherwise unresolvable. From the biggest wars to a fight on the playground it's always one of those 3 things. So you might be wondering what the hell that has to do with anything. My point out of that is that conflict is inevitable and necessary. I can't stand people who think everyone should just tolerate everything even if it conflicts with their own personal views. That's like telling me I should hold out my hands and let someone take a shit on them and like it. Do you have to agree with me, Hell No! Do I have to agree with you, Hell No! What if we just can't come to an agreement............then it's time for a fight! I do have to tell you something.........while you were picking daisys and doing drugs and watching TV.........I was working out, eating right and learning how to fight.

I do enjoy FFXI, but I think it's in part due to the fact it's based on a series I already know and enjoy. I remember a few years ago Bandai said the they were going to release a Gundam MMO, when I heard that I quickly and promptly  urlLink pissed  myself.

"Last Sunday I completed my first long run, 5 miles. Not bad. I followed the suggested training regimen this week, even the Friday cross-training session. My packet of training info suggested that “pool running” was, “…hands down the best cross-training activity for runners…”. I decided since I bought a swimsuit last fall, I would put it to good use at Yale's Olympic-sized pool.   The only person in the area who didn't think I was a complete idiot was the undergraduate student lifeguard, whom I informed of my intent to “pool run”. He was a member of the Yale swim team, and, “very familiar with pool running.” He proceeded to describe types of pool running exercises, and while trying to explain one in particular, asked me if I was familiar with water polo. I replied, “No, but I know how to play Marco Polo.” Unfortunately, my childhood days of Marco Polo training proved insufficient…   Referring to pool running, the article states that, “… it looks a little odd.” Well, they were right. All 15 or so people at the pool, including the children trying to play around in the lane next to me, thought I was a complete whack-job. To give you a better idea of what pool running looks like, think of a common dream you might have had or heard of - you know, the one where someone is chasing you and you're running but not going anywhere? It's like that, but add to your mental picture: 8 lanes of professional swimmers, 1 lane of 3 kids trying not to stare, a swim cap, goggles, and Melissa Bourgeois trying to “run” to the other end of the pool without drowning. That's pool running.   Although I looked like a total ass in the pool, I felt great afterwards, much unlike I feel today. It seems I have either mild food poisoning or a stomach virus – either way, I can't even think of food without wanting to vomit. Suffice it to say I will not make my 6 mile long run today, which I am very disappointed about. It's only going to make my 7 miler next week that much harder. I'm trying to get as much rest as possible today so I can try to make up the long run tomorrow. We'll see. Right now I'm going to head for the couch and a little comedy central…

"Yup, today was just 'one of those days'.  Everyone has them, they are inevitable, along with many other things in life.  I woke up late, and isn't it funny, it seems that most days when u start them off bad by sleeping in when you shouldn't, they just go downhill from there.  It's true, observe your day next time you wake up late...  but it wasn't the small annoyances that made my day 'one of those days'... these small things such as being late for work, the kids being off, tripping over EVERYTHING, breaking my cell phone (on one of the trips ), and losing my keys just made the bigger things in my life... much BIGGER today... As I look on my life right now, it seems like utter chaos, and I don't like it.  I am trying to be strong, but lately I just don't know.  How do you gracefully walk away from someone you love no matter how right you KNOW it is, especially when you are sending them straight into the arms of someone else?? Between this, and many other things going on, I , for the first time in my life, feel completely lost.  And I spend a lot of time trying not to feel sorry for myself, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  I don't know how people can deal with so much WORSE, and it happens. Daily and in tragic ways.  So,this pattern of thinking does put things in perspective b/c my life isn't exactly tragic, but my sentimental side tends to still succeed in getting in the way.  Anyway let's just say that after today, I hope I wake up one time tomorrow, so it's not another ""one of those days"" :)

"This is kind of a wierd thing, having the opportunity to write about nothing in particular with no intended audience.  I'm not really sure if this is something I will do or not, but maybe I'll give it a whirl and see how it goes.  Basically, here's my story: I'm from a small town in southwestern Minnesota.  I grew up raising cattle and growing corn, wheat, and soybeans.  I had and still have both my parents as well as a brother and two sisters.  I was a smart kid in my high school and was always in the top of my class.  I never partied or got in trouble and was generally a good kid.     Then I went to college.   I went to NDSU in Fargo, ND in the fall of 1997.  There I learned to appreciate the sweet necture of life that was and is beer.  There I met some of my best friends and learned of the best mixes of all manners of alcohol.  We partied hard for 2 wonderful years.  Then, I got a letter from the dean.  I was asked not to come back to NDSU in the fall.  They figured that having 2 years to think about things, I'd be better off.     Well, what's a guy to do?     This guy decided he needed to get his head on straight.  I went out to work as a camp cook at a bible camp I had went to as a kid.  It was a rustic fort in the Black Hills of South Dakota with no electricity or running water.  All I had to cook with was a fire and a hand pump.  It was wonderful.  We'd shower only once a week, hike miles a day, and have lots of time just to commune with nature.     While I was out at the camp I talked with a friend who was changing schools.  The four-year schooling at a ""typical"" college was wearing on him and he needed something different.  He was joining up with a buddy that went to a Tech School for Fluid Power Technology (hydraulics and pneumatics primarily).  Well, I thought that sounded as good as any options I had so I signed up over the phone.  Never set foot in the building til the first day of class.  Turned out, that was one of the best decisions I ever made.   But, that's probably enough for now.  If anybody's even reading this, I'll fill some more in later.   Cheers, Drewbie

"A letter of complain  Dear Ms Tang, I really must have to complain about the summer camp that organized by your company. I was one of the first students from my school to go to this camp. Expecting a relaxing camp, the camp was totally a disaster! There were many problems in the camp, such as there were holes on the tents, all the sport equipment was broken, foods were horrible and a very dirty beach.  On the first night of the camp, it rained. So we decided to stay in the tent to play some card games. However, there were holes on the tents! The rain dropped through the holes and made us all wet. Also, it made us unable to sleep and even so, some of my classmates had caught a cough after that night.  Finally the rain had stopped on the next day, therefore we all got out and wanted to enjoy some sports activities. When we got to the sport equitmenp room, we found that all the things were broken. We couldn't play football because the football had a hole and so do the basketball. We also couldn't play the tennis because we couldn't find the tennis ball. All the things there were like a mass and made the room just like a rubbish room. At that day, we did nothing until noon and all of us were bored.  Hoping for a delicious lunch, the food was awful. The food was badly cooked. For example the fish had bad smell and seemed that it had been cooked a long time ago. The soup was the most horrible dish. The color of the soup was black! We didn't want to eat them, but we were all hungery and there were no restaurants nearby, we had to eat them. In the afternoon, many of us felt sick and had a stomach-ache.   The advertisement of this camp said that there would be a beautiful beach near the camp site for us to swim. However, the beach was terrible too. The beach was full of cans, glass bottles, paper and so do the see. We all disappointed about the camp and we all thought that this was the worst camp that we even had.  I was totally not satisfied by the services that provided by your company and we are claiming the total cost that we spent on the camp which is totally five thousands six hundred dollars. If you don't give us the refund, we will take further action by sending complain to the consumer Council.  I'm looking forward to receiving your prompt reply.  Yours faithfully, K. Ng. K. Ng.

I am reluctant to visit her. I have more important things to do. Or not. I'm simply proving my strength by rejecting her. I blew off a girl in the hospital. I destroyed Tuesday's visiting hours for her. It just sets in how evil that sounds. I was in the area twice since. Neither time have I visited. It is sweet karma though. Upon her whole family.

"Today? Is a word, which means the present day, time, or age? So today would be  June 17, 2004, the time 2:00AM, and the age not sure yet. How about I rewind back to this morning and then tell a little about what got me here today……  (Place here the most annoying sound in the world) that would be my alarm. It’s 10:30 in the morning (I just went to bed 5 hours ago) so what do I do? I hit the snooze button. Six thousand beeps and an hour later I finally decide to wake up but not by choice. My sister Whitney runs into my room and tells me something don’t know what she said because my mind was still on weather or not I was wearing cloths. By time I got up and took a shower puts some cloths on. I figured out that she was telling me that the food was ready my Step-Dad had made lunch. So I eat then walk back to my cave (my room) to continue my computing experiences. Which doesn’t ever end.  From there on I just sat and sat watched some movies and listened to some music. Talk on the devil I mean AIM. 8 hours later I go to the best place to eat SUBWAY. Then I retreated back home to continue my online enjoyment. This went on till about a hour ago when I remembered a Tech TV show called “Call for Help” (use to watch it a lot till the show got canceled a few weeks ago)  Where a guy said something about blogger.com. So I was like what the heck, and checked it out. So here I am now setting here in the dark, except the glow from my monitor writing about the most boringness day in the world, or just close to it.    Now for some info about my Family and I. Family, 4 sisters and 2 brother and older, which would make me the youngest and I’m 15 year of age.  The oldest 30, my parents are divorced and both re-married. One of my brothers is in Iraq; the other is in Wichita Falls in Texas going to collage. By the way I leave in Texas, Fort Worth actually. One sister just graduated and then other will next year.       Well now that you know a little about me, made you might be able to understand some of my anger sometimes and maybe you can’t…

"let the anonymity begin.  i think we all have something we want to talk about, but that we can't quite bring ourselves to reveal to anyone we actually have to see face to face. i have an overwhelming feeling (regardless of its veracity) that no one will quite understand what i'm saying. but if you do, please share any insights you have with me. my views are not extreme or disturbing, just a challenge for me.  let's start with the introductions. i'm a 27-year old single female. this is NOT a solicitation for men to start asking me out. it's simply a fact. i love being single and being able to do whatever i desire with my life. i've recently returned to grad school and changed my career/life path extraordinarly. i've also moved to a new city where i have made some great friends (mostly male, as is the norm for me). i come from a christian household and still cling to my faith despite doubts and challenges. the big challenge currently is sex.  for better or for worse, i have a sex drive. currently, it's driving me mad. but i also have a moral code that keeps me from even entertaining the idea of casual sex. due to my odd combination of faith and life interests (drinking, smoking, crude jokes, liberal hippie crap, independent lifestyle, tolerance, tattoos, piercings, etc.) it is very difficult to find anyone who is compatable with me. and that's the beginning of the trouble...when i do someone who looks good on paper, i cannot get interested (even though i desparately need to release some pent-up sexual energy). i'm not looking for a solution, per se, but i am frustrated and venting. what am i looking for? HOPE.  so if you got it, send it my way. are you a christian man or woman who has found a great sexual and life partner despite not ""appearing"" to be the christian norm? i often consider giving in to a casual encounter, but i honestly don't think i could physically go through with it...and i'd certainly beat myself up afterward. not out of guilt, necessarily, but just cuz i know that's not what makes me happy.  life is good in so many ways, and hopefully through more of the posts i can open up more of who I am to myself (and to anyone who cares to read them). i am a very odd combination. and i like it :) but i think most people find me very confusing (probably think i'm a prude)...and they like it from about 10 feet away. goodnight moon.

""And The Phoenix's cycle had reached zenith, so he consumed himself in fire.  He emerged from his own ashes, to be forever immortal."" Some examples of the Phoenix Form are Quetzalcoatl (Aztec), Shiva (Indian), and Ra-Atum (Egyptian). The Phoenix is associated with the concept of life, the number 0, and the element of fire. His sign is the eclipsed sun.  As a member of Form 0, you are a determined individual.  You tend to keep your sense of optomism, even through tough times and have a positive outlook on most situations.

"Hello,      I am trying this blog thing for the first time, I kinda like the idea of it... today has started off pretty good, I still have to vacum the house... yesterday was a great day... unfortunatly the voices in my head keep on telling me to do things, things they have never told me to do before... they used to always tell me to kill and to hurt... but now they are trying to help me I think, you see, yesterday I went to the mall with my girlfriend, and we went and saw a movie together. My voices only come out in the dark and it happened to be just dark enough in the theater for me to hear them. Throught the whole movie they were telling me to do stuff like, put my arm around her, kiss her, stuff like that... sometimes it got plain disturbing the things they told me (I won't repeat them...) but overall yesterday was an awesome day... last night though, when I got home, they ""punished"" me for the times that I wouldn't listen to them... they were screaming inside my head that I am worthless, that I have no chance of having a real life if I refuse to listen to them... and last night I had a dream about what it would have been like had I listened to them... I don't know what to do... I think that they are trying to trick me to trusting them so that they can eventually have me do things that I will really regret... but I don't know... also... my girlfriend's ex, Richie (grr... must... kill..), keeps on telling her that she has to break up with me and start talking to him again in order for her to have a chance of getting back into thespians, god, I truly do hate him... he is using things that I can't stand that I said against me now... and it really get's to my girlfriend... god, I love her so frigin much... but I just don't know what to do sometimes... I think, hell, I know she still has feelings for him... but I couldn't confront her about them in a million years... my best friend, kevin, thinks that I should break up with her... but god, i just couldn't bear to do such a thing... well, I'd better go...

"I am a French born Hong-Kong guy. I have always wondered what my life could have been if I was not born here but there.   I have always wondered what would my life be if I grew up with people of ""my kind"", if people stopped asking about my origins and more about me.  I have just started a new job after a year where I have been mostly doing nothing but having fun, meeting people and having a heartache. Heartache ? Yes, I kind of left my heart in Hong-Kong the last time I went there in December 2003. I stayed there for a month and a half and found out I really enjoy the life there.   Really I do, even if it is harder to leave in Hong Kong than in Lyon (France). Even if work is tougher, even if I would spend more time commuting, even if I would have less money.  I think like I belong there, I don't read nor write Chinese but I speak Cantonese. I kind of feel alive there.  Is it because each time I have been there was on vacation ? Maybe. Now I want to try the real life there.  I have to stop hesitating.   Last time I was there, I attended a wedding. This time, I will also attend a wedding of very close relatives.  I often listen to a radio show from RTHK 2, Mak sir is on the mic and always says : Never give up ! From his point of view, anyone can start over from nothing any time in his life. I agree with him.  With everything I like about HK, why do I hesitate so much ? Am I affraid to leave my family ? Maybe. Am I affraid to fail my endeavour ? Maybe. Do I have th guts to do it ? Yes. Do I have money to do it ? Not quite.  I have to make up my mind in the next couple of months.

"Hey, life. I am kinda sceptical about this whole talking to myself on the internet thing, it just doesn't seem like something I would do...But hell, I have one life, so I might as well try everything once. Just so anyone who views this knows, I am a 17 year old junior in High School, I play football, basketball, track, and golf (I am a starter on all teams), and I love hanging out and hooking up (what's new, right?). Any-hoo, today was a pretty weird day. It started like a usual day, getting a ride with my mom to school cuz my licsense is legally suspended. Going to first period was nothing new, but it was what happened afterwards that really kinda upset me. For about the past two weeks, I have been helping out a friend (who is a girl, just for clarification), get a guy that she really liked. Well she finally got him, and I like to think it was me that got her the guy. She was scared, and I gave her confidence in making the first move. She didn't want to hurt friends, so I went and told the friends just how the girl felt so that they wouldn't get in a fight over him. She asked me every night what to talk about and every night she told me just how much she liked him. Getting back to the point, she walked up and told me she finally asked him out and he said yes. The part that really hit me was that it was then that I realized, How can I get her a boyfriend, yet I can't even tell the girl that I like that I like her???I pretty much got those two people going out, and yet I can't get a girlfriend, I can't tell the girl I like that I like her, and I can't even manage my own life, but yet I helped my friend get her life in better shape. How is that????If you have an answer or an opinion, post back please.

I've done things like this before and have been told I'm ""fucking hillarious"" so we'll see. Today I'm not feeling very comical just feeling alone and bored. Anyway that's about it for now if you want to know more, just ask.

"I've got to go watch my favorite television shows, so I'll be brief.    As a conservative, I'm more than a little fed up with the liberal bias in the media. Disgusted isn't really the right word-I'm disgusted with the blatant anti-Americanism of the flag-burning war protestors, I'm disgusted with the self-absorbed corruption at the UN-but the media bias...it can best be compared to a child singing an annoying song, incessantly, over and over again. They're AWARE that they're injecting bias into their news. They're AWARE that it's wrong. However, they're not going to stop doing it...because on one level, the annoying song-singing child enjoys singing the song, on another, it enjoys annoying the people around it. Eh, that's the best comparison I can come up with on such short notice.   Perusing the internet a couple of years back, I came across this wonder of wonders: THE BLOG. Conservatives around the nation had taken opportunity of this new miracle of technology to protest the liberal media. Good for them.   Since then, both the media and the celebrities around the nation have turned up the heat on their criticism of Bush, all the while proclaiming that there was a 'chill wind' of repression silencing them. Such sheer pretentiousness on their part served to give me a headache for a few hours, but nothing more.   However, they've begun to go to far. They've gone beyond the realm of 'bias' into the realm of 'propaganda.' I realized this after I was able to deconstruct the basis of a Time magazine article ('How we got Homeland Security wrong) with a calculator, access to google, and no more than five minutes of my own time. When something like this happens-when a trusted and widely read magazine starts putting out bullshit that can be disproved with eighth-grade research and math skills...well, things have gotten pretty bad.   Instead of sitting around and bitching about it, I've decided to throw my weight into the fight, by starting this blog. Whenever I can, I'll point out liberal media innaccuracies. Whenever I want to, I'll write opinion pieces.   However, unlike the mainstream media, I'll be honest with you. This Blog will be replete with right-wing bias, ranging from moderate to, as the media would put it, 'extreme.'   Thank you.

"For half the day I practiced a song that my sisters and I are singing at my Dad's 4th wedding Friday night.  The song is a bit ironic considering his track record, but what are you going to do?  I was pleasantly surprised with how well it went.  Now we just have to try it at the church with amplification.  Scary!!  It is mildy terrifying as I haven't sung in public for approx. 11 years.  I figure if I just close my eyes I'll be okay.  I am really dreading the whole weekend.  We have the rehearsal on Thursday night, rehearsal for a wedding my son is in at 3pm on Friday, Dad's wedding at 6:30pm Friday night, than the other wedding at 1pm on Saturday.  I won't have a minutes breathing space until Sunday, on which we are invited to my nephews birthday party.  Bleah!!!!  And sometime in there, B has to fix his bosses car that is apart in our garage.  I really do hate weekends like this almost as bad as Guard weekend.

It's FRIDAY!  Yay!!!!  This weekend is the Apalachin Fireman's Field Days.  Tonight i'll be taking my daughter to watch the fireworks.  Tomorrow i'll be taking her to my aunt's to watch the parade go up the street and go to the Field Days to ride rides and stuff.  That's exciting.   Yesterday i went to one of those Adult Bookstores all by myself!  How creepy.  It was like me and 10 hairy greasy icky men.  I bought a lovely blue ""personal massager"" w/a dolphin on it to give my clitoris the special attention that it deserves.  I took it up to the guy to pay for it and he was like ""I have to test it"", so of course, i giggled b/c i thought he was joking.  It turns out he was serious... i guess they have a ""no refund, no return"" policy (which makes sense), so he had to take it out of the box and put batteries in it and make sure it worked AND IT DIDN'T!!!  So i had to go get another one!!!  It was very awkward, but the guy was really cool about it.    Other than that, i guess i have no news. Ta ta.

"While my husband is laying comfy in our bed I went to a  board that he frequents a lot.  As I was looking for some threads to post in I found a couple of disturbing ones that he had posted in.  Needless to say, I don't feel very wifely or womanly after seeing what he had posted.  I actually cried.  It makes me feel like he doesn't want me anymore even though I know that is not the case.  I just can't believe that he posted it and all that crap.  I don't know what to do or feel right now. I don't know whether to be angery or ball my eyes out.

"Yesterday I went to my Grandpa's wedding! (Yes, my ""Grandpa."") It was at a super fancy country club called ""Glen Acres"" and it was beautiful! I was all dressed up and wore make-up and heels!I (looked great.) It was a good thing we brought our digital camera too! I got to see many of my relatives that I haden't seen in years. Especially my favorite cousin Brent! We practically grew up together. You should have seen the ladies lounge! It was carpeted and had couches and bathrooms and even showers! My little brother told me that in the mens lounge they had a pool table! I had an amazing time, and I got to meet a lot of new people. I even cought the bouquet of flowers that the bride throws. But I doubt I'll be the next to get married since I'm only just turning 15 in 10 days! I had so much fun that I didn't wan't to leave. I'm going to remember that day forever!

"So here I am...one of those people who likes to hide behind who they really are...someone who is afraid to express their honest opinions because they don't want to hurt anyone. But this is fun because there isn't a single person (well, okay, except maybe my sister), who know that this is really me. Let the fun begin!!!  To give you a better idea of who I am and what I like, I figured that I would start out with some websites that I check frequently. I get my basic news headlines here: www.usatoday.com. I also really like the sight because it has a lot of entertainment news and fun chats so when I am really bored at work, I can bug people besides my coworkers (which is a word that I have never really liked because every time I look at it, I only see the word ""cow."" Granted, some of my coworkers have been along the ""cow"" lines, but still...that is just mean).  I am applying to law school for the fall- mostly because I don't know what else to do and I am actually entertained by the thought of spending 3 more years in school. So I check out www.review.com, www.lawschooldiscussion.com, www.xoxohth.com, and www.lawschoolnumbers.com for some up to date information. Okay, so I am actually really excited about going to law school. I know that millions of people are doing it- so I thought that I would be one of those millions. No, just kidding... I know that the job market will be tough when I get out but it is tough right now and I can't stand my job. Why not get more edu-ma-ca-tion? It is almost funny...I haven't told my friends that I am going to law school. I have good reason but that is definitely something for another entry.  I love to travel and like to check out www.elliott.org for info about deals and new travel news.   I also check out www.eonline.com for celebrity news- yes, I am one of those people. But I have to live vicariously through someone so why not someone beautiful, thin, rich, and famous?!?  Okay, enough for today...I am sure that this is not interesting to most people but it is a lot of fun for me to write and I am sure that it will allow me some creative genuis. Have fun!

(Don't bother pointing out that it doesn't have any more features that livejournal.com :-P I like the way this one *looks*, so nerrr). Still at TAFE... procrastinating... With you-know-who sitting next to me again. I'm already that close to strangling him. How am I meant to survive another one and a half years of this with *him* here??? It seems the more I try to avoid/ignore him, the more annoying he gets! Some people just don't get it. *big sigh* Still didn't have the rest of my team here to work on our group assignment today. Jeannie dubbed me team leader cuz I'm the only one who has a clue about what we're doing... and cuz I'm here. Was really looking forward to this project, but I'm already getting over it, cuz I don't think anyone else shares my enthusiasm for it, and so far I'm the only one who's seen the movie we're reviewing. (RUN LOLA RUN, for anyone who's interested. It's good stuff). So yeah, I'm just dawdling cuz I don't know what I'm meant to be doing with that and can't be bothered doing maths right now. I'm gonna get home this arvo and have to leave within half an hour cuz Michelle has got me teaching the tap class tonight before I go to my own jazz class. It's freaking me out a bit, but I don't think it'll be too hard... maybe even fun if I'm lucky! She says if I do well, she'll give me some more classes to teach, and I might end up replacing the current teacher she has (who isn't all that great). Ooh, note to self: remember to visit www.take40.com when I get home. *thumbs up* Can finally listen to stuff on the net now that we have ADSL. *scrolls up* Wow... I certainly had a bit of a ramble today! Maybe it's the new site. You gotta admit it's pretty funky! Anywho, I'm over it. Running outta stuff to talk about. I shall return. Bye for now!

"I am learning to listen to God's voice. Sometimes he speaks in a voice so small, I have to stop what I am doing just to listen. Like this morning, I had this feeling to pray for my husband. I had to stop what I was doing and pray. I prayed until the feeling left. I don't know if he was in danger or not, but God lead me to pray for him right then and there. Sometimes I wonder what would happen if I no longer listened to His voice. I don't think I am going to take that chance to find out.  I watched Jurassic Park 3 last night. I know, I am one of those people that actually like the movies. I really enjoyed number 3. It was a little different from the others. More action packed. My husband called me in the middle of it and told me I should be studying my insurance books instead of watching a movie. Well, he is right, but I finished the movie anyway.

He has a lot of communication problems, but he has progressed so far since we found out he had a problem to begin with.  There are alot of people who have children with Autism in Plano,TX.

My husband works night. I stay home alot. Its hard to get out and work. Next year when my 4 yr old is in school I may be able to work.   I have always had trouble getting out and meeting people. I am a real homebody and I think my kids hate that. Its very very hard to go out when its just me and the kids. Tiger is loud and strong and loves to run away from me. I love my son to death but some people's reactions to him are hard for me to deal with. Outings with him leave me feeling frustrated that we can't seem to do ""normal"" family activities.

"i think i have a fairly violent and destructive nature, the other day i saw a work line of ants crossing this little path in my garden, you know all in a little line carrying leaves and other small pieces of debris to there nest.   so i decided- without conscious control or empirical decision making- to follow the line and find this magical nest of ants and well, to destroy them. its not as if im a child still so there was no real explorative adventure kiddy stuff, just the pleasure of destroying their city.  so i went to the garage- found a high pressure vacuum suction hose attachment and pressurised some diesel fuel into there home, i was quite surprised as about a gallon went in, along with a flaming book of matches- and i threw a bible in just for good measure- good kindling really, nice thin pages. anyway so this massive jet of fire shoots out and almost cooks me, and the most satisfying part was that NO ants came back out, i let the ones working in the chain across the path live just so they could go and tell the other colonies what had happened.  i was quite disturbed by the enjoyment i got out of the whole thing, but well the world is full of wierdo's that do a lot more worse stuff, so im ok, right?

"Yesterday I spent my day playing on the Internet and bummed that Erin has not called me back. I really big crush on her. I really miss being with someone and I am definitely looking for love - which is very unlike me.  Greg and I went out last night. I haven't seen him all summer. He was amazingly beautiful as always. It was the first time my friends were introduced to him. My girlfriends went on and on about how hot he was. Eric, my ex, was actually the first to tell me, ""he is a handsome guy,"" which I thought was really funny. We got extremely drunk and danced all night long. He came home with me, but I puked before anything could happen.  I like Greg. He is smart and he challenges me intellectually. He is also a great dancer and an awesome kisser. I just dont know if I want a man in my life. I've developed this weird fear of men when it comes to intimacy. Things are a bit different with Greg, probably because he's not acting like he is in love with me. I wonder when he will call again....  Other then that, I am actually considering meeting up with Internet friends at the lesbian bar on Saturday. I'll probably chicken at the out last minute.  I'm going to try my best not to over-think the Greg thing. Or the girl thing. Or anything for that matter.

"Fourth of July: It was kinda boring for me. A few of Rachel's friends came over and we shot off some big fireworks that my daddy bought. It was alright I guess. Wow, okay now onto these last 2 days. I had to wake up at 5:30 in the morning on Monday to get ready to go to my Grandparents' house(which is in Branson--4 hours away). On the way we got McDonald's breakfast(because that's the only meal they can make that is good enough to choke down.) We got to their house at around noon. We came in and talked for a little bit, then we watched the tape of my promotion and from dance camp. Then we sat. And talked. And sat. And ate. And sat. Then my dad and grandpa went outside to unload firewood and they forced me to help them. Okay, I'm not the type of girl that goes out in the woods and loads firewood into a 30 year old Ford truck, but I did it just because I'd rather do that than sit inside and talk to my grandma, lol. When we were unloading it onto the stack of firewood that was already there, I got bit by an ant. It hurt like hell, so I went inside to put aloe vera on it. I checked my phone and saw that Kierston had called me, so I called her back. We ended up talking for the next half hour until my family came back inside and then we ate spaghetti for lunch. After lunch, Rachel and me went outside and rode the four-wheeler for a little while. Then I came back inside and called Cam and we talked until he had to go to baseball. We ate mac and cheese for dinner and then we watched TV for a little bit. Then I called Kier again cause I was bored and we talked for a little while. Then I came inside again and got ready for bed. I figured I should go to bed early since old people wake up early. The next day, my dad came in and woke me up at 9. I was soo mad. So I got up and ate breakfast, then went back to sleep till about noon or 1. My phone was dead, so I couldn't call anyone, unfortunately. We talked again for like an hour or whatever and then we left. On the way home we stopped by IHOP and I got some chocolate chip pancakes. And we got home late last night and I got on AOL, watched TV, the usual. Went to bed at like 3, woke up today at 12. Today Colton came over to see Rachel. They went swimming and she's taking him home right now. I'm sitting here bored out of my mind typing the longest thing I think I've ever typed in my life. Later...

This morning was fine the kids and I were joking around all the way to school so the day started off with laughs and smiles. Then I took the 3 year old to pre-school and we had no problems... I picked him up we had a good lunch and afternoon he fell asleep right away for his nap and the mom is picking the kids up from school..    I found out yesterday that I passed the praxis which is huge for me cuase now I am a certified teacher in the state of Ohio. Whew!! I also got a call on my way to play practice (more about that later) about a job at a school really close to my home town. I am so excited. The principal isn't even asking me to apply just send her a resume and plan on going in for an interview. I had done an experience there and she wants to hire me.. I am almost about to burst!!

"Apr. 22nd Sorry for disappearing for a whole month! The journey was great, you can easily tell from the pictures i added in my album. Now i'm back, fully recharged from this long pleasant break!  Maybe it's a rhythm i adopted from the repeating semester-vacation-semester pattern over time, emptiness usually creeps on me when i've been too long away from my school work (good or bad?). Now getting back to what i was doing feels super-good (don't give me the diagnosis of workaholic^^), especially with the freshness of the long sleep nights still left in my brain.  Mar 11th, I got a new camera!!^o^ The days were so hard when the great sceneries are lying there and you just cannot take them home. You won't wait long to see the best sights in Bangor!! :-)  It's now tow weeks away from easter vacation. I'm already counting the days! guess it's the same for those of  you who are in UK^^ what are you guys planning to do for this long spring break? I'm going on a trip to Scotland and fly from Edinburgh to Netherlands (again^^).  Engjoy the warmth of early spring! I'm sure you will all make the best out of your time!   Feb 29th, after over one week's  construction, this page is roughly finished. It's my first attempt to build a homepage. With the foolproof tools from Yahoo, things seem to go on well^^  Spring still feels afar, It snowed for two days, leaving Bangor covered with pure white. The land shines brightly under the sun, and the colour of sky turned from the dead grey to a clear blue, with just enough trouches of clouds. It would be a perfect sunday if i don't have to sit indoor and work out my statistics assignment...    Feb 21st, I started building this page...  Since one and half years ago, my life started to float and i've been moving from one place to another. The new places fed my curiosity and brought freshness into my life. Yet friends come and go, it's indeed too hard to keep close friends close when we are all busy moving on in our lives.  It's not until recently, when i was talking with an old friend, did i realized how little i have been sharing my life with my friends. Let this page be an encouraging start. Do come and sit for a while when you miss  your dear friend!

"there are so many people in the world. Some of us are trained and broken and some of us are jst broken by choice. Reality sucks and everyone knows it. If you want a meaning in life then you have to find it. But if you want to suceed in life you have to be buried in it.Is there really a choice in what we want? Why do people hate? does anyone Know? I htink that people hate out of fear. Fear of change, fear of difference and fear of everything staying exactly the same. Everyone wants what they cant have, unless they dont have anything at all then they want nothing but need everything. But if you have it all you want everything and need nothing. we inven tmore and more things to make life simple, but in turn it just makes everything more difficult. you have money therefore you dont know what its like to be without or if you dont have any money you dont know what its like to have. everyone is unique, we have our own thoughts, thats what makes us who we are. We all like And dislike different things. we all believe in different things, and everyone says they like it that way but as soon as they find out someone is different from them they want to sprint in opposite directions of eachother or they wnat to make eachother like themselves. Everyones perfect. you all say were not because everyone makes mistakes, and thats what makes us perfect. Our differences and mistakes. NoOne is perfect to us because we base our lives on imperfection, therefore noone knows what perfection is. In order to find out who you are you have to experience as much as you possibly can or else your not giving yourself a chance to be happy. thank you for reading this even though i know its really scattered and probably makes no sense to you. i apologize.

"i believe that there are some things in our better half that only us can see. No matter how people insists that they know the person inside out, i'll shot my ten cents to prove them that they are wrong.  this is such a sleepy saturday. i woke up so early and i have to be in the office by 10am. it's ninoy aquino's day... definitely, a double-pay holiday =) it's my kuya ed's birthday. but none of those made this day a special one for me. i've been so screwed for the past few weeks. bad break-up, scary starting overs, the betrayal of friends.. whew! but those were swept away by this happiness im feeling right now. what feeling can overcome the joys of being in love? yeah, same old, same old... just an ordinary story... for YOU! but this is a whole new feeling for me.  i fell in love with this person wherein from the start, all eyebrows are raising, all rumors are spreading, all comments and objections are flying in the air. i'm scared. but what the heck! knowing myself, i love making my life fussy. im interested with risks. and god! I AM IN LOVE! that's the most important reason, isn't it? and so the story goes...  along the way of our relationship, all the negative notes i heard from my friends about my partner that made me real scared are all appeared to be the opposite. things i heard are way far different from what i've seen. and what do you expect from people around you? again, the raising of eyebrows...and worse, they betrayed me when i least expect it. at first, it really hurts... but now, who cares?! anyway my other friend told me that i should trust my instincts.  today, i woke up early with a big smile on my face. knowing that this person proved that even the most devil creature has good sides too =) but oh.. im not saying that my partner is such a demon. hahaha dont get me wrong. i love her for who she is. im happy... very happy...

"Adventures always start in the most unlikely ways. A random email from someone with the courage to think outside the box ( thanks Si!) has tempted me to dip my toes in the world of the weblog. I don't know where this will lead, if anywhere, but a chance to unjumble some of the thoughts racing round my head can only be a good thing! I think everyone reaches a point where they have to stop and say, is this really the life that God has mapped out for me or am I just imposing his hand on my own faltering steps down the expected path. It's not that I think I'm in the wrong place physically, I just think maybe I'm on the wrong level. I think the catalyst has been the birth of my daughter. Two big blue eyes watch every move I make with unnerving concentration, taking in the things other people may have glossed over in the past. Suddenly I realise that what I say may count for very little as, seeing everything, she's going to see the truth. Don't get me wrong, there are lots of positives, I'm just ready for more. I suppose I'm just looking for a way to let my mind spill on to the screen and see if what lands there starts to make some sense!

"So I didn't get around to posting more earlier as I expected....I'll get better.  I'm now over halfway done with my marathon summer semester.  I never took Physics in high school.  Not sure how I passed Chemistry my junior year.  But, for now, I'm doing well in Physiology.  I'm loving it!  Science is cool.  I spent the last 20+ years fearing references to science and now I want to go out of my way to read or watch them.    Admittedly I have changed over the past year or so.  A life crisis (as opposed to a mid-life crisis which I am not old enough to have yet) let me to decide I want to go into nursing.  To do that I have to plunge into science.  Now I find its not bad.  Where did I get the impression it was?  The larger question in my mind is what happens in our schools that so many children and teens like myself end up hating science?  Can something be done to change that.  Everyone has different interests; be they theater, media, science, athletic or something else.  However, shouldn't our schools foster at least an interest or respect for all areas?  With obesity increasingly an issue athletics are important.  Science technology is equally important.  What would life be without music or theater?  In the rush to standardize test I think we are missing the large point problem.  It is that kids should enjoy school.  We have all had good teachers who make learning fun.  As a society we need to study those teachers and start pushing for more like them.

He only got down to the last string before he stopped and it was still alive and cleaning it's self like a cat. I was pretty disturbed by this so I begged him to finish the job and just put it out of it's misery. I know this one is in connection to the recent beheadings in the middle east.

"I heard about a couple of jobs at work I applied for the other day. I didn't receive an interview. I'm pretty dissappointed about it, I thought my application was quite good... I was never expecting to get either of the jobs, there are people at work who definitely deserve them more than I but it is still a sensation not dissimiliar to a kick in the teeth. All my friends rallied around to make me feel better but of course when you feel like that there is very little someone can do to help. It's a matter of stewing for a few days and then getting over it, I am becoming a master this year it seems. I offered my application to my friends at work for there opinion, they all said it was pretty good, but I only got a truly honest opinion from one, my good friend anthony, he told me that while it was good, I used passive language which they warn you against, I really appreciate his honesty, you have to respect it. I think he might be one of those friends you meet rarely that you should try and hold on to for the rest of your life.. you can't waste a good friend. I actually feel the bunch of guys I've met in the last couple of years while working where I am, are the best I have ever made, they are not like some of the friends I had in high school who seem to use when appropriate and forget you at other times and I honestly don't think they ever thought about it, or the friends they are unwilling or just unable to share any emotions deeper than a bottle of beer with you.. at some point you must grow up.  I was told by Anthony the other day when he read this for the first time that adnd is an old acronym for Dungeons and Dragons dating back to 2nd Edition and that die-hards upon reading my first post would pick me up on it... and I have to say if that is so, then you really must start doing something more than dnd with your life, okay!

"I have had it up to here! If you want to know what my life is like today, here it is in a nutshell: My name is Claire, I've just finished my GCSE exams (thank God!) I'm going to Oxford this weekend, and I am worried, stressed and pissed off simultaneously.  My brother Martin is a drug addict who has made my family's lives a living hell for the past 4 or 5 years. He is 15 in August. My parents are separated, and my dad has a heart condition. One more severe heart attack and he could die. Martin broke into my dad's neighbors house where they live in Aldridge, and now the police are looking for him.   They have just broken into my dad's house to search for him, and my dad's landlady has just called to tell him at work, so he's on his way home to do some damage control. I'm worried because my dad could get evicted as he is only renting the house, and he has worked really hard on doing it up so it will be a reasonable place to live in. He has been looking for a house for ages, but everything that seems to go right usually gets screwed up by my darling bastard little brother, so I don't know why I'm so surprised. At last count, my brother has been expelled from 3 schools and 1 college, and he hasn't attended school properly since he was about twelve.   There you have it. My fabulous life. I can't trust anyone completely in my life except for one person, who will not be named here. She is my rock to lean on, and I don't know what I'd do without her sometimes. I'm also annoyed because I don't trust any of my other friends enough to leave them in my room when they are staying over, because I think they will look for my private stuff. My songs, my stories... I have to hide everything private in my room every time they are there, and so even though people can read this I'm safe because none of my friends even know what a blog actually is. I know I sound like a melodramatic little whiner but this is seriously what my life is like. Between me and all my friends, we have enough problems to end up on Oprah or a similar show on a regular basis. This blog will be my way of telling our stories respectively.

"So here I sit at work. Only three more hours left, I guess that's not so bad. It's over time so that makes it even better.    This online Blog idea was very clever. The user interface is very easy to use. I like it.    So when is it too soon to say I love you to someone? Or is there even a time limit on feelings and emotions. I don't think there is. I use to. I use to never believe in love at first sight. But just because you don't believe in something, doesn't mean it's not there. It's amazing how I use to think when someone would say, ""Oh you'll know when you've found the person you want to spend the rest of your life with."" I'd think to myself, how can that possibly be? How can you possibly know that just after meeting someone. Use to think it was all just movie talk, hollywood glamour to sell movies and merchandise. But I believe it now. I think deep down in my heart I had always wanted to believe it, but never wanted to get my hopes up for fear of being let down.    An Ex of mine use to get so aggrivated with me during our break up, cause he kept asking me if I see him in my future. I kept telling him I don't know. Because well, I don't. He kept asking if I had hopes for us to be together again, and I said, No. I don't have hopes for anything. Never have. It's better to have never hoped for anything, then to have been let down by those false hopes. But is it better to have loved and lost, then to have never loved? Going through the break up, I began thinking it's better to have never loved. But in recent events, I couldn't change my mind quick enough. I would rather have loved, and lost. The joy of being with that one person, and sharing moments and experiences that would never be the same, is priceless.    Well there is quite alot there to read. hehe I guess I should probably get some work done.

"Yesterday when I was browsing I found this link. How? I can't even remember, I was looking for something totally different. I started reading some of the blogs and since I've been so lonely lately, I decided to try to write some of things that come to my mind. One of the things that I can start talking about is how my life has change from last year. Now I'm single again. I got a divorce. I can't say all the fault was his but mostly yes, he cheated on me. I think the hardest part has past. Now I need to look forward and try not to think about ...what if? I did everything possible to save my marriage, because I have a little daugther and I wanted her to have a family ...forever. The same way I did when I was single (the first time). I'm so lucky to have the parents I have and the sisters I have. Now I appreciate all the efforts that both my parents did to keep us all together and happy.  (Today is the birthday of one of my sisters, by the way) So, the point is that all the perspectives I had about life changed with this tragic episode in my life. Really, everything I believed before is kind of ...gone. I just hope that divorce is not the same for everyone, because mine has been hard mostly probably because of the relegion beliefs I had. I said I had cause now everything looks so different. I'm so happy for all the people that has found love, true love, now I realize that having someone to share your time and ideas is one of the most imnportant things we can have, more than money. (Of course money always helps). Sometimes I think if I will be able to trust again, you know as a partner and find someone that I can count on. Someone to grow old and have wonderful memories, Do you think is there such a person for me? Last night I was thinking about all the relationships I have had in my life and always end up the same way. Men cheating or maybe is me being to naive.   I'm liseting Rod Stewart an old song, I like to liseting the oldies, well I'm not that young, I'm 43, although I don't feel so old. I like to exercise and do a lot of things with my daugther and her friends. I guess most of the tv shows I know are from Disney channel. An about movies well most of the movies for kids. I have had so many challenges in my life but definetely this one is one of the hardest to pass. I'll let you know how I'm doing later...

I don't know how much I'll write on here; I tend to start something for a week or two, then activity falls off.  We'll see how long I can keep this one going.    I'm sure you want to know a little about me.  I currently live in a nice little suburb of Chicago called Schaumburg.  I moved up here a little over two years ago to go to law school at DePaul University, and to be slightly closer (by about 1200 miles) to the love of my life, Kristen.  I have a year left of law school (woohoo!), and then it's off to the real world.  I have a passion for three things in life: Kristen, flying, and good food.  Near-passions include country music (yee-haw), four wheel drive, good movies, and probably a bunch of other stuff that just doesn't seem to come to mind at the moment.  As I write in this, though, y'all ought to be able to figure out what I'm into and what I'm not.  Well, that's about enough for now.

"car shopping today went well. i'm really looking at two cars, the nissan spectra and the a saturn coupe. both have the basics that i want, sporty look, power everything, sunroof, standard transmission etc. the spectra has got more balls than the saturn but i think i'll get a better deal with the saturn. this is my first experiance buying a NEW car. soo many choices, i feel like a kid in a candy store..hehe  still no real resolution on the female issue. seems as though it get more complicated whichever way i go, so i think my plan is going to be to just ride out the storm and hope for a better days in the future. i know i know not a very creative solution but i honestly can't think of anything else.  on a different note i was thinking about the relationship my generation has with their work. my parents worked three jobs when they were younger and to this day i haven't know them to complain about it. they saw it as a chance to make money and as simply doing what you needed to do. it's strange that just one generation later we see people who can barely handle working one fulltime job and endlessly complain about how much they do. i really believe if we worked harder as a generation we would not only do better personally but do more for each other. not to get too religious but catholics believe that forgiveness/redemption is not based on faith alone but also on good deeds. maybe if we did more for each other on a regular basis we would all be better off, then again that's just my opinion...

"I went over to my brother's yesterday evening to give him a demo of Knoppix. It was a CD which I got with my Dutch magazine PC-Active. The version is 3.3 His impression before putting the CD in was that Linux was overall much to difficult to learn, after all, he'd been using Windows since he has a PC - which is a fair few years now. When the KDE desktop appeared with working sound his face simply lit up. He didn't have to say anything, I could hear him think ""wow!"". We had a look through the main menu-structure and just ran a few programs - Mozilla, KMail, KStars, the Control Centre. He was simply impressed. I have to say, even from the CD, Knoppix is fast and reliable. He's now going to play around with the CD for a while and will probably get more enthousiastic as time goes by. In a couple of weeks (days?), I expect a request to make him a permament install on his hard-drive. He had just had a lot of virus-related problems and his windows-box had grind to a halt a couple of days ago. He was very interested in learning that with this operating system, no more of that would happen. He was also worried he wouldn't be able to do the things in Linux he did under Windows, but after showing him OpenOffice.org, this was no longer an issue.  Oh, by the way, there is a new version of Knoppix, 3.4 - read all about it on the  urlLink Knoppix website

Is the person who said this depressed or not? Answer only in a Yes or a No.","]  No, the person is not depressed. Their tone is enthusiastic and optimistic, indicating that they are excited about their brother's positive experience with Knoppix and the potential for a permanent install on his computer."

"I saw Leif yesterday.  For those of you who don't know he used to be my old roommate and a good friend of mine until he tried to rip me off anyway he could with rent and bills.  He also lied to me every opportunity he got, and then he had the audacity to tell Ryan that I lie all the time about everything.  I really could care less if I ever see him again.        Anyway, I was walking through the mall with Ryan and her mom yesterday and he and his daughter were looking at purses.  I saw him and I tried to get away from him without him noticing me.  It didn't work.  ""Yeah, that's right, Adam.  You just keep on walking,"" he said.  ""Okay,"" I responded and I kept on walking.  He responded with, ""Shmuck!""  And then he saw Ryan and said, ""Hey, baby.  How are you?""  I guess he still likes her.  I have no idea.  I really hope that's the last time I see him but I doubt it is.  A few weeks ago Ryan and I were driving back to her house and when we got to her street he was driving past us.  We turned around to see if that was him, and he turned around and drove past us again.  We turned down another street to get back to her house.  He passed us again.  Each time he covered his face, and Jennifer (another former roommate of ours who is now dating Leif) covered her face so I guess we wouldn't recognize her.  We never saw him again that day, but is he stalking me now?  Was he just bored so he got his two kids and girlfriend in the car and set out to find me?  Will I ever be rid of this guy?    Last night, I got home and Belinda (my roommate for another month) was in the kitchen.  She was leaving to go stay at a friend's house for the night, but before she left she told me that my room smelled bad.  She blamed it on my shoes or trash in my trash can.  She told me I needed to get some candles or an air freshener.  This caused a fight.  It was our first fight since moving into the place last August.  The only thing that I smell in my room is the air freshener that she put into my room a month ago that smells horrible.  My shoes are brand new and therefore do not stink.  The only trash I have in my room is paper.  My room is the only room in the house that actually smells good.  The rest of the house smells like her sausage and Slim Jims.  Anyway, I cleaned my room last night and hopefully she'll be happy now.  I only have three more weeks left in this place and after that I won't have to deal with this anymore.

"Wow. I can't believe how fast the summer's gone by. But WAIT! It's NOT over yet!! You know, if I was in school right now, the next 2 weeks and 1/2 would be a really long vacation. So I have to keep thinking that way. Not  School's almost here,  but  2&1/2 week Holiday.  Hey, that's longer than Christmas break. I'm not too anxious or whatever about starting again, it's just the same old, same old to me. I always like to get new clothes! That's the fun part, of course. Everyone is so scared about seeing people again. It's only been 3 months! Not three years! And like, who really cares what ppl think about you. So I don't look totally different.~ So what? I've given up on the whole must-try-harder-to-improve-my-look craze, I just wear what I like  ; have my hair and make-up the way I want it. I remember in 8th grade I would wake up at a quarter to 6 sometimes so I could get my face and hair just right. Now I wake up at 6:30, and spend a 30 minutes on all of that. (mostly because it's early and it takes forever to wake up) Anyway, I'm rambling.. as usual.

And Mrs. Bovender is simply awesome.  And as excited as I am I'm also not really looking forward to working myself to death.  But it's encouraging to think by the end of this year I'll know Calculus, and high-level chemistry, and be fluent in Latin, and know more about the history of the United States than I ever wanted to know, and be able to write an incredible essay in a short period of time....not to mention play a piano concerto. :)   Gah the PSAT is soon too.  I had this grand idea of me making like 2000 flashcards and learning all the words but I'm so tired right now.  I have to read my other book this weekend as well...which I haven't even started on.  Life is just too complicated sometimes...having to juggle schoolwork and music and social things.

"It is amazing how the time of lunch comes so slowly. At work the time seems so relative, that I feel like I understand Einstein's theory of relativity, and I could even make my own contribution if I hadn't been so hungy. Sugar levels are dropping. Concentration diminishing.  As I correctly predicted the weekend was indeed cold and rainy and on the weather side really nasty. I have seen all types of rain on that day, and I do not care to see them that soon again. But otherwise the weekend was great. I was training my fiancee in driving on our fresh new car and on Sunday we went to see Kill Bill vol. 2 to another country and it was good.  Today my sister is doing university graduation exams and it seems to be going well. Not for me though, because it is hard to type when you are keeping your fingers crossed :-)

"During the last week of March 2004, two friends and I were on a road trip to New Orleans for spring break. The three of us fell for a police trap and were arrested in Stone County, Mississippi. My two friends were charged with misdemeanors for possession of marijuana and I was charged with a felony for possession of a controlled substance. I took the wrap for the six hits of acid we had in the car because the two of them had recently discovered they were going to have a baby. If I hadn't taken the blame, all three of us would have been charged with felonies and the two of them would be in much more trouble now than I am.  Flash forward to today...  I am 23 years old. I am a college graduate (Bachelors in Communication  ; Art). I am employed by my father (who spent $4,800 to bail me out of jail). I work as a detailer, graphic designer, and a networking technician. On the weekends I work for an entertainment company as a disc jockey. I have a $3,000 credit card debt, a $17,000 student loan debt, and a $4,800 debt to my parents. One day, within the next year or two, I will have to go to court for the felony. Right now, I barely make enough money to pay my bills and some how I have to save for lawyer fees. Any ideas grounded in reality on how to handle this situation?

"august  3  my thoughts are filled with just getting out, leaving everything behind. maybe i am a walking contradiction. there is no other way for me but to lead. here i am now. leading. the pressure is getting too much. sometimes i feel like this is not me anymore. i hate some stuff i am obliged to do. smile here, smile there. give commendations. be a people person. i fucking hate all these crap.  there are times i want to be left alone. i want to have some quiet time. i want to do my thing. in spite of myself, i realized all i want to have is a low profile life. a quiet life. maybe that's why i wasn't too keen on modelling. people are so nosy. and i couldn't just smile when asked to. i just want to do my thing. i want to sleep when i want to, i want to wake up no matter how late. i want to dress up the way i want to, i hate ties, i hate looking so yuppy. i want to curse whenever i feel like it. i will be friendly when i want to, i will be nice when i feel like being nice.  show me the light please as i am about to go nuts where i am now.

"But there are a couple of things I've been thinking about.  Does it make me a bad person that I want to just quit my alumni group?  Here's the problem -- I'm the president of our chapter.  I have been for about a year and a half.  But it's not like I volunteered for it . . . or at least not without a bit of arm twisting from the ex-president.  And now I can't find anyone to arm twist myself.  And I want out!!  There's just not enough time in the day to dream up events, organize them, send out a mass email announcing them, reply to responses, etc.  Then I have to actually show up at the event -- early to get seats -- and talk to people.  Well, the talk to people part isn't horrible.  The showing up early is the one that always kills me.  I have to show up early enough to ensure enough seats for everyonee who's coming (half of which probably didn't RSVP), but late enough that I don't have to fight off the waitor for TOO long with promises of a coming party.  Uchhkk.  Let's see . . . what else.  Oh yeah -- I finally found a new apartment!  I'm pretty excited.  It's a one bedroom, so I'll be living by myself for the first time ever.  That's pretty nifty in some aspects . . . I can clean at my own pace (and only clean up after myself).  I can invite people over (or not) at my own discression.  I can decorate exactly as I like.  It'll be like heaven.  Except . . . I'm hoping I don't become a hermit.  Someone at work today joked that I'll be a cat lady.  I won't buy a cat -- I promise!!!  Hopefully it won't be so bad.  My current roommate will still be relatively close (she and her fiancee are moving in together).  My cousin will moving (with his wife) to a condo VERY close to my new place -- that'll be pretty nifty, cause I think we might be good friends -- we've never lived close enough to try before, but I've always enjoyed hanging out with him (and his wife) when I've gotten the chance.  Oh -- and I'll moving close to some friends-of-a-friend that I'm decently good friends with, too (and that I've always wanted to be better friends with).  So hopefully it'll all turn out well.  And it's a damn cute apartment  :-)

"Last night was not our typical Thursday night!  We started the night out with happy hour at Baby A's on Barton Springs Rd. Our friend had her 22nd birthday so we all hung out drinking their signature purple ""way too much everclear in them but we like them"" margaritas.  There is a known rule amungst my friends and I wish to share this with anyone who reads this...if you ever go to Baby A's for happy hour and you have 2 purples, go home or stop drinking!!!! We did neither.    You see, we had an urge...Lava Lounge is one of our favorite bars downtown for two reasons, 1) it's located on 7th street around the corner from Fuel so it's nice to get away from the 6th street crowd! (For those of you that are not familiar with Austin, TX, sixth street is a popular strip that has about 60 bars adjacent to each other.) The music at Lava Lounge is formatted to fit everyones liking.  If you don't like the song on now, the next one will make you happy. 2) Lava Lounge is the home for our Bartender of the Month 3 months in a row! (Bartnder of the Month is voted on by our users)Walk up to the bar and ask for Gary, tell him you want the Marcus and Jack shot! Red Bull/Jager shots will come your way! Enjoy...oh yeah...tell him that ATXNIGHTLIFE.COM sent you!  We did make our way down to the Dizzy Rooster where it just so happend that Dax from MTV's Punk'd was at the bar.  We talked to him for a bit, and he said that he was in town filming a movie with Greg Kinnear (I think that's how you spell his last name).  It's funny how when you see someone on TV you have a certain idea of that person, but once you meet them, they aren't exactly what you imagined.  I pictured Dax as the party guy that goes out and drinks the night away.   Party Guy: yes Drinker: no But we had fun anyway! He was a pretty cool kat and the ladies sure loved him.    When we finished our sixth street bar hop, we ended it right where we started...Lava Lounge.  *From here on out, this is here-say: we walked into the bar and the place was packed!  We walked up to the bar 5 minutes past ""1st last call"" and Gary started making us shots.  The night couldn't have been better, good times with good friends, and one hell of a cheap tab!  Oh...I forgot to mention one thing...I met a midget who was an ex-pornstar! (or so he claimed...didn't matter cause he was surrounded by a crowd of girls, so we talked to him.)  God love the nightlife!!!

I dunno...I haven't been going out with Sarah long and I don't know her very well, but I feel like its always gonna stay that way. We never seem to spend more than a half an hour--tops together and theres never any conversation. I wish we could talk or see each other but maybe shes just too busy...Guess I'll just have to wait for that one day when I call shes home or she calls me to see her...that one day...somewhere down the road.

My mom is already taking us and she said that if Rose's mom is coming, then she's not taking us at all! I agree. Rose's mom was pretty mean to Cynthia when she told on Rose for pushing her.(She acctually made her cry!)AND........ Rose told me that her mom told her that she doesn't like it when Rose walks w/us to the library n' stuff because she thinks that me and Jessica act like we're so cool and that we dress up all pretty just to go to the library! That is soooooooooo not true!!!!! I think she's just jealous!!!!!!! That made me so mad! I told Jessica and she didn't like it either.

"To expand a little on my previous thought.           I spend about 95% of my free time alone.      I am engaged to my childrens father. This is the 3rd time we are engaged.    He wanted to elope, but I feel I deserve a wedding after all that I've been through. We live in different places. I, with the children at my parents house, and him with his mother and family.        His mother had a kidney transplant in December. I understand that he wants to be there for her. But my children and I suffer greatly.  He never comes around. When he does, she (or his sister) calls and he leaves.        Sometimes I think she exaggerates her pain (maybe I sound a little selfish) or maybe exaggerate isn't what I mean. I think she tolerates her pain until she wants attention. I feel bad for her because she suffers alot. But at the same time. I never get to see my ""fiance"" , my kids never get to see their father.     There is a house down the street from her. And the people want around $700    monthly for a 3 bedroom house.  He decided (without me even seeing it) that it wasn't good enough because the house is blue, fiends (drug addicts)   lived   there, and the kitchen is yellow. He can't see taking us from where we are now to move there.        He lives in a 3 bedroom house with about 6 people and a dog. I live in a big 4 bedroom house with my parents, and I am cramped. My son doesn't like to stay here because he thinks my parents don't like him.  My daughter has to stay upstairs with me, because they yell about the house being dirty. She doesn't like it there much either. But he doesn's see moving us from here, because of a freakin yellow kitchen.       I haven't been able to sleep or really eat since he told me this last night.  If anyone can give me a honest opinion on what's really good, I'd really appreciate it.

"Ok...This gonna be a long story. There were a couple in the XXX school. They were both secondary 2 at that time. They loved each others deeply. The girl shall be named Yi. The boy shall be named Le. They would sms each others telling how much they love each others everyday. They will greet each other morning and bla bla bla~  Yi does not treat Le very well but Le love her deeply. He would shower her with presents occasionally. On Le birthday , Yi does not give any Le any birthday presents. Le was upset at that time. He heard from Yi's friend that she will be giving Le presents but in the end it was just for air. Le was very understanding. He thought that Yi might be having some cash flow problems as both of them are teenagers. On that day , although Yi had nothing for Le , he was still happy when his good friends help him celebrated and others wishing him.  Since then , Yi's friends will to say to Le that Yi is not treating him as her stead. But Le didn't mind at all. Le is still a happy boy with her.  Things start to crack. Le was calling her friends and asking why Yi didn't treat him so good like other couple do. Soon , more and more people were joining in the conference. Some encourage Le to break with Yi. On that night , Le break with Yi.  Yi was very upset as she don't know why Le break with her. Le was upset at that time too. So he decided to join gang to ease his suffering. Le still love Yi that time but just don't have guts to patch with her.  When Yi birthday was coming , Le decided to go to city hall saint andrew church to pick some ' love seeds ' and put it into a bottle and give to Yi on her birthday. On Yi birthday , he wrote some notes telling Yi how much he still love her and he wanted to patch with Yi. He stuff the notes into the bottle of ' love seeds ' and told Yi's friend to give it to her as he got no guts to give.  Despite how hard Le pick the seeds , Yi refuse to patch with Le and she had stead with another guy call Yuan.         After around 1 year , when they were both secondary 3 in the same class. Le got news that Yuan break with Yi. Yuan and Yi were together for 9 months. Le wanted to patch with Yi.  To be continued...

"I went to the little lockin at Magic Springs last night and we were there from 10 at night till 4 in the morning. It was not worth the money. That's messed up that it cost $17 when I bought a pass. That's why I bought a pass, so I didn't have to pay to get in. I'm really tired today. I'm kind of disapointed that Jaclyn was out of town this weekend. We were supposed to go bowling tonight but she had to go to El Dorado. I would have rather gone bowling than to Magic Springs. I think this chick at the church was stalking me. I was walking alone, thinking about stuff, and she saw me and left her friends to walk with me. I had not even met her before tonight but, it turns out she was one of my ex girlfriends best friends sister. How ironic? Oh well, she was pretty cool. Then when we got back to the church we watched t.v. Well, most everybody slept. Jenna tried but I kept her awake, he he he. Jenna and I finally got to talk, I'm glad I got that stuff off my chest. Thanks Jenna. Jaclyn would be proud of me today, I slept from 6:30 this morning to 3:00 this afternoon. I'm still really tired though so I think all I need to say has been said. L8r.

"I was at a wedding in NH this past weekend, and I can't help but wonder how many more weddings I will attend before I myself get married. I'm not dating anyone currently, but this getting married thing seems to be catching on like wild fire. Not that I am opposed to it. In fact, when I was in my last major relationship, I was pushing for it myself. But why? Did I think he was the one? Well, it did cross my mind, but I just saw him for the first time since we broke up on Sunday (after the Sat. wedding) and it is amazing to see how far we both are from that now. Does it make sense to get married when you don't know what you yourself want out of life? I'm starting to realize that the answer to that last question is 'no.' So, I don't think I am going to go looking for a husband any time soon, since I need to figure out my own path first.... but I must say, it is difficult to sit there by yourself and witness all the couples planning their weddings knowing how far off you might be. That must be a girl thing though!

"OK. I've been wanting to blog for awhile. Thing is I can't decide how honest I want to be in it. What if someone in the family found it? Guess I'll just have to take that chance. So anyway, what I really wanted to write about is Shana. I hate talking to anyone in the family about her because I don't want to upset them. I mean, what if they're having a good day? Then I pour out all of my stuff and make them start grieving again. Although I know, realistically, that we'll never stop grieving. I still cannot believe that she killed herself. Immediately after, that week, sometimes someone would say it must have been an accident. But come on, Shana was brilliant. She knew how little she was. Taking a bottle of anti-depressants and pain pills was not an accident. She wanted to leave. She wanted the pain to stop. That's why she took them at bedtime.  I still hear my brother describing how he found her. Right after we got to the house he told us everything. Took us up to Shana's room and showed us her bed. Showed us where he carried her to the top of stairs and tried CPR. Told us the police had to pry her out of his arms. Told us she was already getting stiff. And she was cold, he said, so cold. Sometimes I can't stop hearing the stuff from that week. I can hear him crying my name.  I remember so much from that week. Picking out the fingernail polish, helping Grandma iron her clothes. Previewing her hair and makeup with my sisters. We took a picture for reference. My sister was so tough. I couldn't see the details through the tears but J did.  Even writing in my journal I feel like I need to edit stuff out. But I can't. It's time to get this stuff out. Shana's been gone for over a year and I still don't really believe it. She was only 19 and had so much to live for. I'll never stop wondering why.  Her suicide note was in her live journal. Titled ""Enough is Enough"". That's it. I'm done. I love you all... The same message, or maybe a little longer, was set up as an 'away' message in outlook. I never could bring myself to email her so I'd get it back as a reply. I asked my sister if she'd made up an album of Shana stuff. She said she thought the pictures belonged interspersed with other family pictures. I don't know though. Seems like I might do an album - but do I put the funeral notice and program in there too? I wanted to keep them. Don't know why.

"to everone older and younger than i am, i would like to say that i am sorry for the way things will be. a lot of my peers are senseless, ignorant, angry, and belligirent. god forbid any generation raises a new generation that's not intelligent as they were,well unfortunately this has happened. as i approach adulthood i look at my peers and wander how some of them could ever become productive members society, and how they ever could function as rational, inteligable adults. i see childlike outbursts of violence, lack of respect for others and athourity and an overall lack of concern for the future. very few of my peers have an intrest in anything that could help the development of our country or our society or themselves,it's not cool. i fear that our parents will be left to control the country in their old age instead of their chidren.i think that our society will becom more corrupt andviolent as time progresses making the world a not such a great place to be. i fear that the next generation will be even worse, kids having kids is not cute it's stupid, and laughing when your or your teenagers baby does something wrong is not cute or funny ,its even worse, it teaches your child to develop an unhealthy outlook to the behavior it will show to everyone as he/she grows up.to my peers learn to show a little respect, no mater how grownup you think you are shut up and listen, weall have a lot to learn. to the adults, i'm sorry that not all of us are great children, not the best generation yet, by far, also please don't try to defend your childs wrong behavior because you feel you are being personally attacked as a parent, it's o.k. to defend your parental beliefs, but be careful to check wether its your child or your pride you're defending, and also we don't really hate all of you we may be angry and do stupid things but we still love you parents/gaurdians.to the babies of my peers i am truly sorry, you will have a really hard life, your parents are probabally underprepared, and ignorant of how to raise a child.  everyone may not agree with what i've said, it was not intended to offend any of you, ut whats said is said, idf you think i'm wrong, then don't take it to heart. i may very well be wrong, i've still got a lot to learn.

"Today was an intresting day to say the least. Sometimes I wonder way the hell things are the way they are. I try to be a nice person but when you are nice, people will run the hell all over you. Today I had to turn in my best friend for getting a traffic ticket and giving the officer my name instead of hers. Did I just call her my best friend?........ With friends like that i'm set for life huh?. Well I bet she wont do it again. I guess I can cross her name off my Christmas list.    On another note my son had a good day in school today. I couldn't be more proud. I was so worried when he started school but I think that he will do fine.    As for my love life, thats not doing fine at all. I am intrested in someone but I just don't think he sees it, or me for that matter. I've done everything possible to get him to notice me.   Don't get me wrong we talk quite often but there is always people around. Hell maybe he just isn't intrested. I could see that as the problem. I'll keep hoping. I have nothing better to do.........

"this is the first time i ever done one of these, it seems a little awkard for me considering i'm such a shy person  But i feel its something that i need, no one listens anymore.  Its like there deaf to everything i say, i'm going unheard....its a really painful feeling.  i heard a song today by story of the year, ""anthem to out dying day"", it was a song that appealed to me in no sort of reason, but i still felt compelled to do something.  i have listened to it non-stop for about 2 hours and it still hasn't gotten old for me.  Its a new one for me considering i like songs for about a week then never listen it for awhile.  i don't know what but it appeals to something in my life, something i've been wanting for awhile.....her. she is one of the most perfect people i have ever seen i my life. She lights up my entire life when ever i am near her.  its like nothing i've ever felt, and it aches...because i can't tell her how it feels...how will she react?  she is the type of person that isn't very open...like me.....i can't just tell her ""hey i love you baby!""  that just won't cut it, for me and for her.  It seems like she wants something more in a relationship, something i'm trying to find and seem to have found, but can't tell her.  Will she reject or rejoice?  I know it seems like a cliche type of love story but that is just the way this story is.  I wish she would just run into to my arms and say, i love you and nothing is never going to change that.  My heart grows heavy when i see her with other people...other men...i always feel like my window is closing to her..like i'll miss my shot..and i will....i just can't do anything about it.  I won't too, but i just can't.  I don't want to ruin what we already have.  I keep thinking that she will freak out and our relationship will never be the same with her.  Its a solitary confinement for me.  No windows, only a door, which i'm afraid to open, afraid to see whats on the other said.  Something lies beyond the door that i want too see, but i am afraid too...what happens if disater lurks beyond the door...

"Francis is my name, and i am a beginner bassist. Trying my best to practise for my one a biggest dream! That is to form a band with my friends. We target english rock, though i myself prefer chinese and jap rock. But through my friends' persuation, I decided to try it out. It's hard to enter the english rock market, cos nevertheless, white skins hate the yellow skinned, thus therefore they will definitely not support. Without the white skinned market, it's hard, god damn hard.     Ok, enough of my dreams, now to introduce myself further. I am a 17 year old chinese boy, sporting black short hair, little funky hairstyle, i'll try and post my pictures later. I'm not studying, cos i need to work for money to fuel my dreams.

So not really a day at all! Yay!       Intresting incident walking to the stop de bus avec le Sharon - I swung my PE kit at her head. Now if she was normal, it would've flown over her head, and she would've just been scared of being hit in the head. Whereas Sharon, not being normal, held her phone in the way. So it pinged into the road! Ah-hah. Well, it was really funny at the time. Then I bought a lighter, and I made the flame big(ish), only it wouldn't go out, and scared my thumb.       Then saw Will. Exploded the lighter. Saw the retards that work in Budgens. Hehe. It's the law - only retards are allowed to work in Budgens.

"Well, this is my second blog, this time I am having a go posting via e-mail!!  What have I been up to?  Well last night I drove home and as it was so sunny I decided to take some pictures of my building to show my Grandma when I next go home.  I rang my Grandma and my sister Sindy.  I have agreed to move in with my sister next year and her boyfriend Art, if I don’t they will have to move.  Their house is really nice, plenty big enough and it would be wonderful living in London.  Plus I think I will feel more ‘settled’ down there.  It would be good for Art too as he will be able to use my car.  I don’t have a job lined up but I have my long term plan sorted:  Temp/bar work and apply for proper jobs, if I don’t get proper job by January, apply for teacher training.  It’ll be fine…..  Last night I also worked on a website for work a little bit and then watched TV.  My house is a tip so tonight I think tonight I will do lots of cleaning and tidying.  I have an interview on Friday for which I should really be revising, but you know, tidying’s better than revising (ask any student!!)  Well today the sun came out again bright and hot.  It’s sad being stuck in an office on a day like this.  I’d love to be stretched out, outside with a book.  Ho hum.  Today is a quiet day at work, this afternoon I may take some more images of phantoms with the gamma camera but for now I’ll just sit here and try and do some theory.  Roll on the weekend I say!!!

"Labour leaders more often than not tell us how they will ""die in the Party"". Blair said that he wasn't born in to the party but he will die in it. I now know that this is a very useful device for making people rule out the idea of ever leaving Labour and it's a phrase that sounds good, and it's one I've copied and used myself for dramatic effect. But when it came to it, when this War criminal leader decided to throw in his lot with George Bush, stayiong in the Labour was not an option. What should have been the most difficult decision I've ever had to make (after 10 years flogging my guts out for it)  leaving the Labour Party was not only an easy decision but essential. How could anyone stay in a Party that stains itself in the blood of thousands of Iraqi civilians, dropping cluster bombs on them against the will of the UK and International community, against the UN, against the Law and for George W Bush, Rumsfeld, Cheney - Financial and War criminal one and all - and with the Tories, Berlusconi, John Howard, and Aznar.  We couldn't even be bothered to count the bodies. If anyone stayed in the Labour Party after Abu Graihb I wonder what they joined the Labour for in the first place. If it wasn't for justice and for an ideal that may or may not be obtainable, at least it was aspirational for humanity. I can't even begin to list the sheer number of crimes against people, society and democracy that this Labour Party has been responsible for and every single member is to blame. Your money has paid for a montrous, election winning machine that believes in privatisation, War and inequality. All the talk of saving the Labour Party from Blair is to miss the point. When a Party becomes part of the problem it doesn't deserve to survive. The dead children in Iraq will never be brought back. A new leader will not be able to lessen the personal pain I feel knowing that by helping to elect this Labour Government I also have blood on my hands. The Tories would never have got the votes in the Commons to conduct such a filthy War. Only a Labour Party wilting at the feet of it's Leader could have pulled this off. I will never rejoin the Labour Party and stand shoulder to shoulder with people who justify slaughter in such an ignorant detatched manner. My new pledge is that I will die outside the Labour Party.

"I have a lot of kids, the fur baby kind. I love each and every pet I meet. That doesn't necessarily mean that I WANT each and everyone that I meet, because I don't. I believe that they all need to have their OWN homes where they are special. To me they are all special. It can be very hard to make all the cats  feel  special and I do try to make them feel that way. I don't like to see them broken hearted when a new one arrives. That causes me stress. Sometimes new arrivals require alot of attention and the other cats get their feelings hurt and start to shy away. That breaks my heart too. Plain fact is that I need help. I need foster parents to take in orphaned babies so they can be adopted. At work we get so many calls of people finding orphaned kittens and the shelters here are full. I can't take them because my sancutary cats have been exposed to FIP. If they come here they have to stay forever. I already found 5 orphaned kittens myself. I had no where to send them so now they are here to stay. Anyone out there want to help bottle feed babies? If you do and live in Pensacola, FL call me: 261-0760 or 492-6878. I will start a list and give notice at work that I have foster families! That would be too cool! Those of us that work in a Vet Office, we are there because we LOVE what we do and we LOVE animals. Believe me, the pay isn't that great! We have our hearts broken weekly and sometimes several times a day. It is an emotional business, protecting and saving lives.

""what a bad friend,"" i thought.   later on the night about an hour or so after, i ran into this fella again. i notioned for another dance. he was kind enough and said yes. so we danced and had small talk. then he said, ""i don't mean to be rude, but can i have your #?"" so that's how it all started.

"Hello. I'm so glad you've come. Would you like a cup of tea? I like mine with two heaped spoons of sugar and full-cream milk. But you can have yours any way you like. I'm not going to stop you.   Well, I might as well introduce myself, since you've made it this far. And you look like you're comfortable so I've got nothing to lose.    My name is Mrs Walker and I am 26 years old. I live in a pink square house on Harlem Avenue, in a working class neighborhood ten miles west of the Chicago loop. My husband, Mr. Walker, and I, bought the house in April and we moved in on May 1.   Our house is different from other houses. From Harlem Avenue, our house looks just like a pink square lego brick that's come alive and has grown eyes and a mouth. In front of the house is a strawberry field and there are five fruit trees on our double lot. We have grape vines growing over the deck and peonies, roses and other exotic looking flowers exploding all over our Chicago plot. On the other half of the lot (it's a double) are neat blocks of soil divided by wooden walkways. We have planted corn, brocolli, carrots, beans, tomatoes, peppers and herbs here. Every day my husband and I look on in astonishment as the plants rise up out of the ground in their mission to feed us.   When we first looked at the house in March this year, we had no idea what was already in the ground. The stawberry plants, berries and grapevines have all burst forth since we moved in. In the last two weeks we have picked perhaps half a dozen pounds of strawberries. We've given away baskets to friends and I took a couple quarts into the office one day. We've made strawberry jam and I tried strawberry fudge but I didn't wait for the mixture to get hot enough and it didn't set. I threw the whole pan of fudge out and only had to feel guilty about the dollar or so that I spent on the can of evaporated milk, and the three cups of sugar.   Well, that is not exactly true. I was sorely devastated by my failed fudge attempt and I bought new ingredients at the grocery store today. In fact I'm going to attempt a new batch again right now. If it turns out alright this time, I'll share the recipe with you.   So please come back to visit. Next time I may even have a chocolate biscuit for you to eat with your tea.

"I’d like to share a quote I particularly like:   	“We find comfort among those who agree with us - growth among those who don’t.” 									- Frank A. Clark  How are we ever suppose to grow and learn if we are constantly surrounded by people who agree with us?  When you sit and discuss a topic with someone else who has an opposing view you will learn more from that one person than if you sat and discussed that same topic with 10 other people who believe what you do.  Although, I have found some very interesting conversations start up between people with the same views who are just pondering other possibilities.  I have a friend who is interested in the building sciences like I am, the two of us can get together and just bounce back ideas about what if this were to happen or if this one thing changed wouldn’t that make a huge difference to the houses and buildings going up right now?  It’s really cool to have someone on the same wavelength as you.  But, as far as growth goes, I feel I learn more by talking to someone about a topic that we are opposed on rather than have the same feelings.

"once i was sitting in the school hall having the first pe lesson,then i was looking around.when the teachers were preparing the stuff for the lesson,i spotted a girl at the oppsite side of my class.I watched her and cared nothing else,by then i realise she was my girl...once i met her at a bus stop,she was with her stead,but i didn't know that that was her stead.Thus i sat at a seat behind them,and heard what are they talking about.then as time flies,each time i looked at her,the more i liked her even more.Then,at mid august,i finally got the courage n asked her for stead,i was that surprised that she accpted me.then it lasted for a week,plus a day.we broke up, she didnt want to hurt me,cuz she had her ex in mind.somewhere at the last day of school,i asked her for stead again then we patched up for 3 days and broke up again.because of the sparse communication..when school reopened,we tried to act like nothing happened.but we still can't forget that we had the past together,we were like steads,we act like one,and we got even closer to each other.On the 27th july,we patched up.then,kelly exposed our relationship,and she was her best friend,also my friend,jac scolded her for doing this,i don't know what happend,and i actually tried to defend kelly.that dy, i sent her home,we were taking bus 105,we sat in the same sit and held hands,we treasured the time we had,and that was only the time we had together alone.but on the 4 of august, we broke up,she told me that she was a bad stead and broke up with me...then finally on the 7th of august she expained why...she again said that she was a bad stead,and her parents n brother knew about our relationship..she wanted to protect me,and she broke up with me..and she does not bare to break up ,she was crying when she told me all this,and there is nothing i could do to help.i can only see her tears rolling down her cheeks.then she took her bag and ran out of the school,i felt helpless,and started wiping..i hated the world to be so unfair to us..all we wanted i a stable relationship and nothing else..but in the end..we still have to go seperate ways...and each time i thought of she saying...i don't want to break up but i have no choice...tears will start rolling down my eyes..i did not give up once,i will wait for the right time..i will always keep her in my mind forever...

"Oh my!   I haven't been back to post at all!  Have you been visiting my website?  It's prolly going to be moving soon as Atlantic Broadband has bought out Charter Communications.  Charter was my previous ISP.  I'm reworking the site, and making it pretty before it's time to upload it to Atlantic.  I've been busy knitting, crocheting, supporting my Fiance in all his endeavors, looking out for myself, keeping my children well-behaved and productive members of society, and feeding the cat now and then.  I'll try to be better at posting!  Hugs,  Carol

"Okay... so maybe this thing is the new livejournal bandwagon. Who knows. Don't really care at this point. I'm far too lazy to maintain my own blog atm, so this is going to work just fine for me.   I find myself wondering why I persist in this constant struggle with my shape. It seems like no matter how much I cut back or how much I exercise, I don't change all that much. I'm supposed to hit the Dr in 2 weeks to have her tell me I'm too fat. Thrilling, eh?   Also we have shifting managerial garbage over at work, and that has me stressed out. I  want  assistant manager really badly. I don't know if it'll ever happen. At this point, I'm afraid to transfer over to the other store I'm offered right now because of a few things.  One, the store itself is a nightmare. Everyone steals. Employees, customers, you name it.  Two, It's huge. More work. I feel like I bust my ass as it is. The story I hear about the new place is that no matter what happens, no matter what you do, it always gets undone. No matter how fast. You come in next shift and it's a warzone.  Three, The drive time. I don't want to commute again. I like having my 5 minutes to and from.  Now.. it's a good thing to transfer. Bigger store = more money and more hours. But that doesn't mean that it'll compensate for the amount of time taken from my day or the cash guzzling car's gas tank I'll be paying out the nose for.  The largest deterrant, however, is the fact that I'll have to close during the week. I don't want to. Closing's a pain in the ass. Sure, it's the easier of the two shifts, but hey, I don't like being up that late and not having anything to do when you get home because it's too late to watch a movie and you're too wound up to sleep. The only plus to that is that most likely, I'd no longer have to do inventory shifts.   At any rate, I decided not to take it. I just have to call the boss and tell her tomorrow. I want it, but they'd have to at least give me a 1.15 raise just to have me do it. That's what my time's going to cost them if they want me down there that badly. Which they won't. Heh.

"Okay.. a little about me. I'm married, with 3 lovely kids and an adorable husband. I have just taken a leave of absence from my job at The Home Depot. HD is a pretty good company, but all of the jobs are very demanding and most of my coworkers feel VERY overworked and consumed by their jobs. Before I worked at the store in my town, I worked at the Store Support Center (aka headquarters) in Atlanta, Georgia. I was involved in arranging travel for associates with the company, and also for assisting with employee/family relocations due to promotions/tranfers, etc. I really enjoyed my job in ATL, and miss my coworkers. Working at a store is a completely different world. I'm glad that HD hires people from all walks of life, different ages, colors, etc. But there is such a HUGE variety of experience in our store - it is very strange. We have 18 year old cashiers that came fresh out of the Kwiky Mart that wear their hip hugging bluejeans with the g-string underwear showing at the top and their boyfriends waiting on them out in the parking lot. We've got 55 year old experienced professionals that could build a house from the ground up with a crew of 3. We've got weekend warriors, firemen, schoolteachers, students, homemakers, who just want a part time job for a few extra bucks, and high school students working on the lot, pushing carts, and dreaming of making their way in to management one day. I guess VARIETY is the spice of life. And let me tell you - my store has a lot of SPICE.

"i just bought a home hiv test kit from drugstore.com.  actually two.  and a bottle of wet platinum (that's stuff's yummy.  makes any session of self-love feel like you're 14 again...  but maybe that's not a good thing.  hm...)  of course, i didn't really NEED two tests nor the lube, but man i'm a sucker for bargains and i saved a whopping three cents for spending fifteen times more than i intended to.  i'm a bargain shopping stud.  the package arrived yesterday at work but i didn't want to prepare my blood sample in a shared bathroom stall.  so i thought i'd do it after a rigorous game of bowling.  and you know how much bowling gets the heart pumping and the body ready for blood sample extraction!  you basically have to prick your finger on these little plastic apparati.  of course, i was too afraid of getting pricked, so i couldn't get enough blood out of my middle finger from the shallow wound i created.  so instead, i doubled the pain by additionally having to prick my ring finger to get enough blood to fill this circle on the sample collection card.  okay, okay.  it really wasn't that bad.  i've learned to type with eight fingers quite rapidly.  no, really.  it's a lot better than getting blood taken out of your arm.  that's for sure.  the last time they did that, the nurse bruised my arm and it hurt to masturbate.  i knew i should have given the nurse my left arm...  but i'm really one big fuck up.  i just got tested a month ago.  but since then, i fucked this guy bareback and then got hit by a flu that came out of nowhere.  and this guy i screwed apparently is allergic to latex and doesn't always have safer sex with his partners.  and did i mention i already have a boyfriend?  i can deal with fucking up my own life, but when i start affecting other people's lives, i totally feel like shit and deserve more than just a couple of pin pricks on two fingers.  i can't even be straight about it.  here i am recounting my home test kit experience with witty embellishments to hide the fact that i'm a complete failure.  i can't bargain shop, i can't prick a finger, i'm a cheat, and i can't even honestly post an anonymous blog.  but at least i saved three cents.  and got free shipping.

"Loneliness dominates you. You can hide it well, but it's there, and your friends can see it. You constantly feel alone, and need to do things to fill your time. You're afraid to tell people this, but sooner or later it gets out in a bad way, and you think you screwed up everything. And when you are in love is when you are sad the most.     urlLink   What Emotion Dominates you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    she came over today. i realized i missed spending afternoons with her. i guess its because i lost her for a while. maybe i needed that.  i have a motto:  paranoid bitches should go to hell.  because when you are, too many things go on in your mind. unnecessary stuff.   i am one of those bitches. ive been ignored. im being paranoid about it. its time to go to hell.

"Well, I took Hoss to get neutered this morning. Poor thing, he was so excited it makes me think he has no idea what is to come. He was like a wild thing this morning, playing and running around this morning. The ride in the car was great! We were stuck trying to find a place to get across to the vet's office through all the traffic, and he just watched all the cars and trucks go by. He really loves to watch the cars and truck moving.  Then we got there, and I had to take him over to the side to go potty before we went into the office. He was a total spaz there! I could hardly contain him and in fact, he got loose of his collar and scared a poor little shih-tzu. They called someone from the back to come get him once I put the collar back on and I appologized to the little dog that was just shaking.  Anyway, he goes under the knife between 11 and 2 today, and I can call to check on him later. Then tomorrow he gets a bath before his daddy goes to pick him up. He'll be like a whole new dog!  Here's a little pic of him when he was a baby...that seems so long ago.  He's only about 7lbs there, but he weighed 62lbs last time he went to the vet.  He's 9 months old now and so handsome!

"I GOTTED GUINEA PIGGIES TODAY!! THEY'RE SOOOOO CUTE! I named mine Charlie amd my brother, Kevin, also got one, and he named his Junior. They're adorable!!! I went to our city's Relay for Life event thingy yesterday and into this morning. We had a group of 8 planned to get together and hang out there and raise money for cancer but, that's where the problem was...RELYING ON PEOPLE! Our team captain and another member were in Europe for out school's Orchestra class, 2 people came...and left without letting anyone know, 1 person came, but had to leave early cause she had to work, which was perfectly understandable. So, that left 3 of us...me, Kendra, and Lucas (I know names mean nothing to those of you that don't know me but, get over it). It was from 6 p.m. last night til 8 a.m. this morning, so we stayed up all night walking our school's track, where it was held. We had alot of fun! I hijacked Luc's hat too...I tend to do things like that when I get bored...LOL. Well, anyway, I'm gonna go...I have work tonight. :'( Byyyyyye!!!

"Well I have been working on this damn thing for the last four months straight, no days off not even weekends, and the end is rapidly approaching.  Friday the 2nd I get to defend this damn thing.  Though my advisor keeps reassuring me I have nothing to worry about, I cant help but shake the feeling that something bad might happen.  Nothing would suck more than spending 3 years busting your ass in a lab, and then not get your masters (or more years and PhD, but thats not the case here). Maybe its just stress.  It may be the fact that I still haven't found a job yet.  Whatever it is, I can not wait to get this over with on Friday, spend the evening with friends, and then start planning for the rest of my life.

"So.... welcome everyone! Yes... after reading many people's online journals, I have decided to start my own online journal.  Today, nothing happened today. I woke up around noon....pretty early for me. I had some ice cream for brunch. My sister needed to go to NOVA to drop off some work to her teacher so i decided to tag along. It was a pretty scary experience; In order to make her 5:00pm deadline, which was thirty minutes away, she sped down the highway like a mad woman. But we made through it.  Afterwards we went to Blockbuster to rent Kill Bill: Volume 2. Normally I despise Blockbuster and I would never support them, but I got coupons in the mail for $0.99. So I finally got the movie and went home....really exciting.  My mom wanted us to clean the house from top to bottom and we promised here that we'd do it. The hours went by and we hadn't gotten to it yet. I pop in the Kill Bill DVD instead. I thought it was pretty good, but i have to admit that some parts were kind of random. My sister was confused the whole time...she usually doesn't get movies like this.  After the movie was done, we realized that it was close to midnight and we hadn't started on any of the shit that we were supposed to. We do a lot of cleaning and finish up around 1:00am.  I apologize for this extremely boring entry but my sister insisted that I start my journal today and nothing interesting or exciting happened.  Oh yeah....I got my senior pictures in the mail today! It actually turned out pretty good. Now I have a dilemma because the slowasses that were taking the pictures took over four hours to do their job and I had to go to work so i left before I can take my outfit pictures. So now i had to reschedule another day so i can finishes the pictures. I don't understand why i have to go out of my way to do have another appointment when those slutty whores at LifeTouch fucked up.  I'm excited because in two days I am flying down to Nashville. I haven't been there since the Christmas holiday and I can't wait to see my family. On that same day, the twelfth of August...it's my birfday!  AGAIN....sorry for this really boring entry and I promise that it will get even spicier!  AND CUT!

"This is dedicated to my uncle, who died on duty at the age of 29, doing police work...       The Day I Cried   ------------------------------------            “Those that I fight I do not hate,        Those that I guard I do not love;”  - (An Irish Airman Foresees His Death, W.B. Yeats)      It was all white in the room,    The corpse in his winding sheet,    My aunt in a new white sari,    Staring into the silence where he had gone.    I could hear the leaves rustle outside the window, But I didn’t cry.      She had gone crazy, my mom whispered,    Between her sobs, “She is just 25, the poor girl”    I just continued to look down,    At the mosaic floor, not registering a word.    I could hear the white saris softly flapping, But I couldn’t cry.      My cousin sister came to me,    Dressed in her prettiest frock for the occasion.    She was five, did she understand?    I took her out to buy her chocolate.    I could hear the neighbors’ shushing as we went by, But I still didn’t cry.      On my way back in the train,    Three passengers were discussing the police,    “All corrupt sons of bitches – they deserve to die”    I remembered you, uncle, so proud of your uniform.    I could still hear my aunt screaming as nani lit your pyre, That’s when I cried.    --V.

"Hmm, lol. Well, I cant really say that this is my first time writing a blog, I have done it before, but failed miserabley! :(  My other site that I was running and maintaining sorta died, when dot.tk decided to kick me off for not having like a gazillion visitors a month, OH, and because my account was free!! :P   Well, I better start writing about yesterday. Well, ( this is gonna be interesting :P) I worked from 4pm-9pm, and had like a 10 min break at about, 8:25pm. Since I had to ride to work, coz my brother was being a wanker and didn't wanna drive me, i parked my bike around the back of the building, ( without a chain ) which i forgot. So at about 8:30pm I decided that i would check if my bike was still around the back of the building where i parked it. Well, to cut an EXTREMELY long story short, it wasn't and after alot of screaming, and alot of profanities being used, i ended up vending my anger into the nearest wall, which happened to be concrete. It would've been alot better if it had been marshmallow or something, otherwise I wouldn't have like a knuckle the size of Kansas at the moment now would I!? :D   After this, I went back inside, and worked the next 30 min till i finished. My Mum picked me up, and thought that since I rode to work, she would be picking up the bike aswell, but no! After an extremely heated discussion, ( more like we were ripping eachothers heads off ) we decided to go down to the police station, ( about 15 min drive awa ) and report the bike stolen. When we were reporting the details to the nice constable, he immediately jerked his head up and said "" oh, is this yours??"" I then had to walk down a long hallway, and he then revealed the bike, and to my joy, I replied "" yes, yes that is my bike ""  Since Mum had gone home to get changed, because when she picked me up she was in her SLIPPERS!!! We now had the smaller car, because Mum believed that we had no chance in the world of finding my bike!! We had to really cram my 21"" bike into the little family car!!  I went home and SLEPT!!! Well, toodles, I shall be back 2morrow, writing about my interested day!!  ( OH, and if your wondering were i work?? I work at Hungry Jacks, Junkfood Corner!!)BYE!!

"Maybe I'm too nice, but it would be hilarious to bust someone out when they are yapping on and on about nothing but lies.  It's the same bullshit over and over again.  Save your saliva.  No one wants to hear it anymore.  It's old.  It's lame.  And most importantly, nobody's impressed.  Obviously they've never heard of that ghetto phrase, ""you ain't gotta lie to kick it.""

My name is Sherrie, I am 27 years old, I live in Kentucky, work for a short-line  railroad company, married to a wonderful husband (Lauren), have no children (yet) and I love to crochet!      My husband also works for a railroad related industry that manufactures railroad crossties. He enjoys his job as much as I do, which is a lot!

I have alot of different projects started, from plastic canvas, to thread and yarn crochet. My most favored project is the 63 squares combine to make an afghan. I have not been working on this project all that long, but I have finished the first 5 squares, and this, I am happy about! I am on the 6th one now, and it isn't as fun. It is wanting to roll up like a paper towel tube and I have to fight with it to make it do what I want it to do!

I really should have eaten a bigger lunch!  Work was so boring!  Me and Adam just sat there the whole time!  There was no one in there watching us and we were so confused half way into the training! We, what we thought was done, didn't know what to do next!  I was walking around with no shoes on in the main office looking for someone to come and help us! LOL!  I finally found someone to help us and we ended up having a ton of lessons to do. They were so stupid.  Poor Adam started nodding off five mintues into his.  Mine wasn't that bad.  I was actually doing my lessons and not falling asleep!  I was trying to learn!  Unfortunately, I have to train AGAIN tomorrow, but Adam isn't going to be there so I am going to be all by myself! :...(      Moving right along!  Haha..

He hasn't really been gone that long and only has a week and a couple days before he comes back home.  I can't wait to see him.  I miss him ALOT!  We made our first HUGE decision together yesterday.  We decided on going to Cameron our first year of college and go  to OU our sophomore year.  That works for me.  I really want to go to OU, but I can wait a year.  OU isn't going anywhere!  Haha!  It would be better that we wait to go to OU and we go to Cameron our first year.  That way we can keep our jobs and continue saving money for our appartment and everything.  I am really excited that we made that decision.  I can plan out the next couple of years of my life now.  I just need to tell my dad and start getting everything I need to get into Cameron next fall.      Well, I don't really feel like typing any more!  I've been typing all day of the computers at work!

"What would you do if an ex came by the house, you are with a new person and that person is SO upset that they might leave you?  So upset at the fact that he doesn't want to talk to you, kiss you, or touch you.  You tell him not to worry about the ex, you wouldn't do anything to destroy your relationship with them. They are your first true love, never find anyone better than them. But still, they are so mad, rub it in your face that you were even with that person. Will make love to you but right in the middle all the heat disappears and cant finish. You say its ok, everything will be ok, but its not. I can understand what he is going through, although not sure I would take it so far. I tell him this, still no help. I tell him that he is my world, my best friend, my everything. I could never want a man as much as I want him...But still no help. The relationship already has a ton of troubles..Kids, work, money, his ways, my ways..Average things. But when you add the fact that he doesn't trust you, to the point that he makes himself sick, what do you do?  Get to the point that they are treating you badly as to block the pain if you do hurt them...Does that really help? Or does it make it worse? You don't like to be treated badly, you where in a relationship that was like that for 6 years, you thought that this person would be different, treat you like a queen. But when they get like this, what do you do? Deal with it until it makes you a bitch? Resentful, hurt, angry.......       They realize that they did you wrong, but the damage is done, the hurt will never go away. How many times can you hear ""Im Sorry"" before you realize that its a easy way out. That ""Im sorry"" doesn't cut it anymore. If they were sorry they would stop doing it repeatedly and change their ways. Maybe they are sorry, but can they really be if they say it so many times and not do anything about the way they are acting?

"I had a pretty solid day today. First I took my spanish exam, bombed it. I mean let's be serious spanish? I don't even speak it how the hell am I supposed to pass a test on it? But then I came home early cause' I had a free period the next exam so I came home and took a power nap on the couch. Next thing I know my sister is waking me up telling me I can have her phone because she's going to get a new one. Well I don't know if you all know the difference between my sister's phone and mine, but it's a big phone. So now I have a new phone and I also bought a few dvds a couple days ago. I got The Simpsons Season 4 (best one) and Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 2. For those of you who aren't familiar with Curb Your Enthusiasm it's the only show that rivals the comedy of Chapelle's Show. I also purchased, ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" it's a good one. But for now I just finished mowing the lawn and I should do Cole diddy's final ""preperation"" for my final tomorrow. Smoke rocks. Mike

"It's strange how one can wake up in a morning feeling that the day is going to be great, only to find that as each minute ticks, things slowly seem to get worse.  Today is one of those days.  Worse than just the average Monday feeling, I haven't felt any good until just now when I started to think about the days events.  I guess when you reach a rock bottom, the only way is up, so I'm trying to think positive that come tomorrow things will all fit into perspective.   Still not heard anything from Morrisons, although they should have received my letter last Friday.  Not really sure what sort of response I'll get but it has to be better than the response I got from Customer Services last week.  We'll see how it goes.   Spoke to Rob, but felt too miserable to say much.  Looks like an early night for me.

Now I'll admit, it wasn't exacltly the star filled night of enjoyment that I hoped for but hey, you can't have everything. But I did, as I do every year, made my new years resolutions that night because for me, the 19th of august is my new year. I decided to have these as my resolutions:  1.Do a couple of pages of notes or one page of new writing everyday.  2.Actually start wearing the nice clothing that people buy for me, and even experiment with a colour that isn't black.  3.Socialise quite a bit more often.

"In the year 2002, was my greatest regret ever. The only peson invoved and to be blamed is me. It was my fault that I did not I did not do well in my P.S.L.E. I was studying in Coral Primary school. There is where my problems started.      Firstly, I mixed around in the wrong group. I was new in Coral Primary as I had just transfered from Loyang Primary in the second month of 2000. In the beginning I thought it would be ""ok"", and the things I did were fun and I enjoyed it very much. I skipped the remedials I had every day to meet my friends in the car park. There I would spend hours to play with fire but I did not smoke. I did not pick up any bad habbits as I already knew they were to harm me. And when I went home I would tell my mum that i went for my remedials. I thought I would concentrate in my work as well as well as go out with my friends. But this did not happen. Instead I started avoiding studies. Soon, I started getting involved in more trouble and later on I started thinking that my friends were more important than my studies. When the time came, that was two years later in the year 2002, I wasen't ready. It was my P.S.L.E. It was now that I realised that my mistakes.        During my exams I went blank in my weakest subject, maths. The rest of the subjects were average. I started to panic as I knew I was going to get bad marks. In the end I did. I did very badly and got into a school I did not wnted, Siglap Secondary. At first I thought that I would do anything to get out, but as time passed, I became to know the school beter and realised it was a good place to learn in. But every where there will be ""this"" and ""thats"". There is no scholl that is perfect. Well, I was confused in what to do, I was lost but I knew that I had to adapt to it and strive to do my best. I was angry and dissapointed at myself on my mistake but I knew I had to let the past be the past. But not forget the past but learn from the mistakes. I learnt my mistakes and I know that I should not do it again. Now I have stuck this in my head that I should not mix around in the wrong company as the consequences would be unbearable and that I should pay attension in my studies. Now that I know the ""good"" and the ""bad"" and now I believe I can achieve my goal.

Last time I did that they made me hold my breath whenever the scanner went over me.  And the tube was really cold, yecch.  I hope all goes well, I really would rather not hear that I need some sort of surgery.  But if I do have surgery there is a pro, I get HOSPITAL SOCKS!!!!  Those are so nice, they have the little sticky pads on the bottom, and they are ever so warm.  The con of the situation is having to wear a gown.

"So how many blogs do I have now? Let's count...probably 4, and I usually only use one which is Dead Journal. But hey, I want a new taste...so I'm gonna use blogger again. For the 3rd time? lol   It was (still is) very windy today. I like this cool breeze...although it was really hot today.   The moment I got up today I knew I was going to have a good day, cuz I woke up briskly and eager to go to Saturday School. But now that I think about it...today was a REALLY tiring day. The most tiring day I've ever had at Saturday School maybe. I mean HAL!! Hal is SO GODDAMN loquacious! (Hahah, there goes my vocab again...) He would NOT shut up!! We did show and tell again and he would make either a sarcastic remark or a ""Oh I have that"" to everything everyone says. YOU SMARTASS!! And then for HIS show and tell, guess what he gets out... fossils and anmonites.  He even made this presentation-board type of thing. And he talks back to me, says mean things that he doesn't mean, etc...that kid absolutely drives me  mad.  But what the hell, at least he's somewhat entertaining...half the laughter in that class is caused by Hal's smartness (and stupidness...today he said 'Stupidity counts in everything.' Daresama yanen...lol) . Talked to Victor today, was nice...he's so cute, hehe. It's so weird how my heart jumps whenever I see him. But his hideous sense of BAGS and HATS are disturbing...lol I guess he likes that military color combination...  Yusuke, Hiroaki, and I were gonna go to a movie tonight but since we found out it ends at 9:05, we cancelled it...plus we might not have gotten tickets, we were planning to see  Day After Tomorrow . That comes out today! So then we planned to go out to dinner, but since I finish work at 5 we postponed that as well. lol   Apparently I might be going to prom with Hiroaki...? Yusuke and Jyongri persuaded him to go with me, and it might just happen! It all depends on if he has the whole outfit though, I hope he does. Well whatever, I'm not too concerned with going dateless after all. As long as we all have a good time...  Speaking of packing, I leave in  15 days!!!  Do you read that Courtney, I'LL BE IN THE SAME GODDAMN COUNTRY IN 15 DAYS! I'll be sure to give you a call when I get to Indiana kk? ;) Ahhhh I'm so excited...XD XD   I must go do homework now.

"Hey how is everyone. Heather has moved here and we are doing really well. We  spent 17 hours in the car this past weekend going to my friend Jared's  wedding and we will be going to Jessica's wedding theis weekend. we haven't  killed each other so that is really impressive. I am a little tense about  the wedding but I guess that is good otherwise I would probably be terrible.  I guess I still might.  Heather is doing really well.  She has been handling the move well even though I know she misses her  friends back in Colorado.  I am considering taking a Youth Ministry position at Fellowship of the  Metroplex. It is a fairly large church wich I am not a big fan of but I am  praying over with Heather and we need your prayers to help us with the  decision. We are also considering some other options of ministry and would  appreciate your prayers. Thanks for everyone's help and support.  Jake

"So there's this life I'm living, and only some know about parts of it, and I can't really write yet about any of it. Every time I find somewhere I think I'm comfortable writing, someone steps in and takes that feeling away, swiftly and murderously. I like to write, it's obvious, I've been doing it for years, but I like to write what I want, about whatever I want, and it's hard to do so while striving for anynomity. I hate having to hide behind a mask of unrecognizable features, just to tell the story of my life. The true story of my life, no frills, no strings attached, the real deal. But there some who who'd most definitely not approve, and though I can't blame her for getting upset at the things I do and think about, I can't help it, it's just how I am. It's the life I live, and I'm still not being very specific. Do you know, that if she were to read this, she'd hound me until the year's end asking what I'm talking about, what things in my life I do but can't write about, what would upset her, blah blah, and we all know how that goes, surely. So instead, I find another spot, and take my time trying to find comfort in that spot, with intent to eventually just write everything. I tire of taking out a pen and notebook, jotting everything down, while knowing I'm the only one who gets to read it. I'm a bit conceited, self-centered maybe, when I say I want others to hear my story, too. That's what these sites are all about, though, writing as a sort of entertainment towards others. That's just what we all like to do.  So with that all said, give me a few more entries where no one specifically is asking me anything, and I'll start writing about the real thing. Until then, please bare with my rambling.

"Watching the end of the Today show...  Monitoring my work email, but not aggressively working today.  I've pretty much checked out for the July 4th holiday.  I have a few things to do this week, but not a whole lot.  I could find lots of work to do, but without them having deadlines, I'm not too motivated.  Yesterday, the tile installers were supposed to come put in new flooring in my bathrooms.  They didn't show up.  They are supposed to be here today, but it's almost 10:00 am and they are still not here.  I'll give them till 10:15 before I call the company and see where they are.  I think they had to swing by Home Depot to pick up the supplies first, so I'll give them a little leeway.  I'm headed to the Pacific Northwest on Thursday night for some vacation.  Four nights in Seattle, then 3 in Vancouver, then 1 back in Seattle before flying back home to Dallas.  I'll spend some time in the city, but plan on getting out into the surrounding country as much as I can too.  I intend on exploring they Olympic peninsula, Mt. Ranier area, Victoria, and a few other places.  Plus a little city nightlife to divert my attention some.  OK, the tilers arrived just now...  so I'll keep my fingers crossed.

"Ahhh, So after a talk with a friend and a weekend in the country I'm much calmer. Saturday was absolutely wonderful. JB and I went to a farmer's market, went swimming then fell asleep on the grass in the shade. The relaxation was much needed and I feel soo great. Oh, we went shopping on Friday and I spent way too much money. I got some supper cute heels though. I've always been into girlie things. I love pink but this season is making it sooo much easier to be into pink. I love it. I bought little pink heels with wonderful tiny black bows on the side. I also bought a bunch of ""work"" clothes.

"It's been 2 weeks, and still I long to be kissed on both cheeks when I meet someone! I want to turn around and go straight back to Paris.   But the ad agency where I work (www.adbiz.com) suddenly has more work coming in, and I've got two new projects on the go for freelance this week. One is search engine writing for a cosmetic surgeon's website. Another, an ad for building insurance. A lot more like this, and I'll be back in France in no time.  I've started on a couple more articles, about onsens and enkais in Japan and the glories of NS in the summer. But I have yet to finish one, since the paid stuff is taking up my time. That, and badminton! We started a club here in Gainesville, and we played for the first time two nights ago. It was fun. Some competitive people there, but for the most part, we just blissed out getting all sweaty (no a/c) and hitting the bird around.  Although it threw me for a loop when my French friend went to kiss me on the cheek instead of shaking hands after our first game. I got a little shy and forgot to do the second cheek. So we just resorted to the regular hand-shaking after that.

"I know that I am not alone in the 'loving the wrong man' line....   How many of us look for love in all the wrong places? How many of us confide in our best friends or our mothers (gasp!) that the man who is most important to us is unfortunately attached to someone else? How many of us intend for these things to happen? Probably none of us. We just seem to have a penchant for something that doesn't belong to us.....  And then I have to ask....does anyone really belong to anyone but themselves? Shouldn't we belong to ourselves? Shouldn't we do as  we  see fit?  No.... probably not. Because we harm others when we do this. Actually we harm ourselves, our psyches, our very souls.  We show ourselves to be without value. We are unimportant. We don't count. And we do this to ourselves.    Do we want to hurt others? No. I don't think that most of us even have any guilt about what we are doing. The man certainly doesn't. I seem doomed to be someone's midlife crisis. And no I am not that young. I am 48 years old and once again in the throes of a relationship that can only damage everyone involved.    He wants my address so that he can send me things. He actually called me once from his home. I asked him if he was out of his fucking mind. I don't know why I am doing this.  Because he smells so wonderfully fine and he tastes so good. Because he kisses like Kenny G's music sounds. Because everyone I want seems to be married ....or gay. Yes folks.... the guy that did my eyebrow piercing is a definite hottie and has two grown kids and an ex-wife and is definitely  uncloseted. And he twinkles and flirts and makes you want to well......I don't know lick him or something....sometimes I hate men.  This one tells me that I am his 'Whiskey Lullaby'. I am not sure if that is a compliment or not. I love the song ...but it is rather depressing and I couldn't help but ask if I was the bottle or the trigger. I guess it is supposed to be a compliment....  Listen to me piss and moan.  If you don't like the heat......get out of the kitchen.

"Stuff goes nuts as soon one gets mad.  As if somehow civility is erased from our brains and mindless matter comes out of our mouths.  Blows thrown at breakable things as if relief of someones frustration is inevitable.  Things twist as a tale changes and turns from moderate to worse.  My wife begged me to let her go her parents house,  while I shaked my head in disapproval.  So I said ""ill make you a deal, I let you go but you clean the house tomorrow.  And get everything ready to go...and I mean everything! including me! get my clothes ready."" As time progressed somehow my wife lost track of time.  Then the time came for me to get ready to go to work.  My stuff wasnt ready as we agreed.  I let my wife know that im about to leave and im not taking her to her moms house.  She gets mad and storms out of the room while screaming  "" I have RIGHTS!!""  me thinking to myself.. ""Fuck man... I have the right to enforce what we had agreed on.""  The arguments got worse as she decided to resolve to threats of what she wasnt gonna do anymore. Of course that incensed me beyond borders of sanity as I thought on my head ""hey its not my fault you took forever in getting ready!!"" We went off to work and she dropped me off.  When the time came for me to come out of work she wasnt outside waiting for me.  I asked around if anybody had a cell phone to call my wife, and apparently nobody did.  So I waited 20 minutes till the next batch of employees came out, and asked them for a cellphone.  My wife answered to my dismay! I asked ""why are you not picking me up!""  She said ""You usually dont come early home so I figured you were gonna take a long time to get out.""  That got me so angry that I almost hit the windshield of my car.  She said ""I have RIGHTS!"" Infuriated as I was I struck the windshield and cracked it."" I was disappointed, but oh well its my wifes fault!!.  Of course I left alot of details out since im so angry right now that its consuming me from within.  It burns me inside as my spirit of goodwill fades into unusefullness.  What a shitty day.

Just like the printing press in 1450, the telephone circa 18something (Google Telephone History, you'll see), and cable TV in the early 70's.  Whatever.

Also, hopefully, this blog will allow me to argue with people. I love to argue, and if a good debate is presented, then I may take the bate.

"My brother and I were at a mall yesterday with two of our closest friends, Carly and Jessica.  I realized something yesterday, no matter what has happened in our lives they have always been there through good and bad times.  I realized that whenever I need someone to talk to I have always been able to count on the twins to listen and to tell me their opinions.  They have always been at our house growing up, whenever school let out, they'd be over for sure. Its hard for me to think of days when they haven't been over at our house. The four of us have done practically everything together.   They are two of my true friends. I have very few friends that I could say that about.  Not many people know me as well as these gals. Now that we are getting older our lives will most likely be keeping us from seeing each other as much as we have in the past, but I know that no matter where we are we will be friends. They have meant so much to me in my life that I can't even explain to you in this one simple blog. I have tried my best to show you, but this is only a scratch of the surface of what these two mean to me. I just hope that I have been as good a friend to them as they both have been to me.  It is there birthday today and I just want to wish a happy birthday to two of the greatest people I know.  Happy 16th.

"Today I got my Orange belt in Choi Kwang Do. The last ""light"" colored belt before Green which goes into the darker colored belts. I took the pictures tonight of the belt ceremony using my wife's Fuji S2. Sharp camera! Since I am an asst instructor I am now teting every month. I have my patterns down through Green belt, and plan on learning Blue and Purple patterns this week. :)  This weekend I did my first ""non-official"" videography event - a ""reception"" party for a couple that was married in Hawaii several months ago. Luckily it did not rain since it was an outside event. :) I took about 2 hours of film. I would think that a wedding would have actually been easier since there are actual ""events"" that you have to capture. This was basically just a party and therefore I became more the voyeur than the observer like normal weddings in that I had to walk around taping interesting converstaions. Luckily the bride & groom both have very outgoing personalities as do most of their close friends. My wife was the photographer (http://oneclickawayphoto.com) so in some cases I followed her around. But as the night wore on and the drinks became more potent I was able to pull out some interesting stories from some of the key attendees. Though I was really wanting Grandma to participate but she did not like the idea of being taped. Must be a generational thing. :)  Have you ever had a mental image of someone you worked with over long distances, but then when you actually met them or saw their picture realized your image was WAY off base? Had that happen today. Man - talk about being wrong. :)   Anyway - I'm off to play XBox. Later!

"YAY! We are refinancing our home! I just finished up my first week as a real time graphic designer too. Working at Trinity Lutheran College is really great. I love the fact that I have my own office. I put in a work order to have it painted and have some extra junk hauled out of there! So I can personalize it as I please.   On another note. I can't stand Keith the Freecycle South King County moderator. He is so annoying! It is like he only owns the group to rule over people to build his own ego it is so annoying.   Paul, Riley and I went to the Lincoln Park wading pool after work today. It got up to 92 degrees today so it was nice to get our feet wet. Riley really likes wading pools. We just walked around with her. Then we went and had dinner at Spuds and walked along Alki.

"UGH!!! TODAY IS FINALLY OVER!  Here is how the day went...  7:30am - Wake up call... Nicolas decides to wake up... ERRR! What happened to 9 o'clock!?  9:00am - Michelle's doctor appointment... Nicolas decides he doesn't want to be in the doctor's office... so we walk around for at least 30 minutes and about every 2 minutes he decides to drop his butt to the ground and pitch a fit.  10:00am - At the hospital and Michelle is with the Lactation Consulant Amy. Nicolas again doesn't want to be in the room... SOOO We walk around again but for this time it's at least an hour. I decided that he might be hungry so I took him in the elevator down to get food stuffs and NOW he decides he wants to be in the elevator the WHOLE TIME!!!!  11:30amish - Adam calls... THE SYSTEM IS DOWN!!! One of the servers puked and all the sites are down... It would have been a GREAT TIME FOR A NAP, but alas... I am the Jesus... Our savior... I spend like 2 hours fixing the server and everything is great.  2:00pm - Nicolas decides to wake up... I take him downstairs and make him Mac and Cheese... what does he do you ask? DOESN'T EVEN TOUCH IT! ERRR I swear to God... When he gets older... if I make him something, he better eat it or it gets the hose again!  5:30pm - Time for dinner... I cook, I clean... yay!  7:00? - Nicolas gets a bath... he cries the whole time... I don't know why... but I didn't brush his teeth :)  8:00pm - Awwww... relaxation... watch a little SNL w/ Lindsay Lohan... it was pretty funny.  10:30pm - I got a hair up my butt and decided to go play DDR... I completely suck now. I haven't played in a couple of weeks and it shows.  12:15am - I go to HEB to pick up a yummy treat for Michelle and to pick up cat food. Alas... I forgot the damn $$$ to pay for the stuffs. Do I look like a complete tard when I tell the HEB guy I forgot my Lonestar card at home. :P  12:25am - Back at home... everything is good...  1:20am - I now go to sleep... will I dream?   BTW - Some funny shit I found today on CNN... YAY!  ""On the other hand, I wouldn't just pull up and leave there if I thought it was going to cause the whole thing to disintegrate,"" Clinton told King.  Hmm... I wonder why he didn't say... ""I wouldn't just pull out""? HAH!

"Well, I made it to graduation....sort of...After slipping by math with the scholarly final grade of a D minus, I acted like Chris Farley in the begginning of Tommy Boy and felt that it was neccesary to brag about my accomplishments to every man,woman and child within a mile radius. Well, not really, but I did call most of my close friends and family. (If you're reading this and wondering why I didn't call you...get over it.) Commencement went well, except for the part where I got the case with no diploma inside!:) The weekend was great, except for when I found out that I had to change my living arrangments because of someone backing out of a contract. I won't name names, but his initials are Tim Taylor.. (No hard feelings Tim :))Only four more weeks of college, and then I'll become as close to democrat as possible so that I can freeload off of society and milk the government for all it's worth until I finally land a job. At this point, any chance of actually landing a journalism job seems about as realistic as bumping into Tom Hanks at Merritt Square Mall. (I'd say more like...one in a million.'- 'So you're telling me there's a chance!'- Dumb & Dumber) Speaking of Merritt Square, the new theater there is amazing. As my good bud Stacey said, the theater's motto should be: Cobb 16- ""Can you believe you're in Merritt Island?"". We saw day after tommorow and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be and they didn't really push an agenda like all the media was saying they would. That's truly a first! Well, I've already typed way more than anyone would want to read so I'll stop.

"Well, today started off OK, I guess. Since my parents sold their restaraunt, they've been off for a bit, but my mom just started working part time at a green house about a minutes walk from my buddy's place. So I had to get up 6:30, which sucked. She dropped me off at school around 7:00. I was feeling OK, I got to the gym, one of the senior players was there. Talked to him for a minute or two, before I worked on some ball handling and shot around a bit.   I wasn't feeling it today, dunno what happened. Nothing seemed to be fallin'. Foul shot was off, the works. But you know, that happens sometimes. Some of the senior girls showed up, we shot around and talked for a bit. Nothing special. I finished off the morning with a game or twenty-one with this kid from my team named Chance. He's gotta be my favorite Rook' on the team. Seems a lot of the other ones are bitches. I was ice cold. I barely won the damn thing. I wasn't impressed at all.   Yeah, anyway, went to Math, got my test results back. 82%. Meh, I wasn't too excited, I wasn't disappointed, but I feel I could do better. Mark went up to 77%. I'm really underachieving this semester. Parents are riding me a bit. Then I went to English, lunch came, same old, same old. French, doing OK in that. Then I went to Socials, as usual Ms. Brown was a bitch.   Hopped on the bus, went home, wasn't feeling great. Came on the computer did some shit on here. Then I went and watched Sacramento play Minnesota. I was not impressed with that missed lay-up by C-Web. Cost 'em the mother fuckin' game. Garnett was nuts, as usual.   MVP style. MVP class. MVP ability.   He's a sick mother fucker I'll tell ya that much. After the game was done I watched the end of the Calgary, San Jose game. Man, everyone here in Van-City has jumped on the Calgary bandwagon and I'm pissed OFF. They're going to the Cup, everyone couldn't be happier, except me. Bastards.   Anyway, that's today for ya.

But even my friends and family kept telling me that I need to break it off because it was affecting me in such a radical way. I will always remember him.

"There are things running through my head today.  What should I do about my future.  I have a decent job, an apartment, a relationship, but  what do I want to do with my life?   There are many things I've wanted to do.  When I was in high school I wanted to be a broadcaster.  When I was in college, while things became less clear, I knew that I wanted to study English and Tudor history and combine them somehow or another.  Now that I'm out of school, all I want is to go back - to do something different; to be something more than what I am.    So, here are some things I've thought about doing.  I haven't really thought them through all the way, but that's what this sort of forum is for, right?    I've always wanted to write books.  Either researching stuff from the Elizabethan or early Tudor time period, or historical based romances or even just plain old fiction.  The problem is - what would I write about?  There are already tons of books about Elizabeth I, her sister Mary, her cousin Mary Stuart...it's a bit frustrating.  But, I suppose there's always room for a well researched, well written book out there.    I've thought about studying to become a teacher.  But, what would I teach?  English or History?  On what level would I teach?  I'm not the most patient person in the world...I'd hate teaching in an elementary school or even a middle school.  So, I guess that leaves high school and college levels.  I'd enjoy having the summers off, but probably not much else.  I'd love to be able to travel for 3 months out of every year.  Or even travel for 1 month and work the other 2 doing something else.  It's a possibility I guess I should look into.    The law has also fascinated me from a young age.  I'd love to be a lawyer.  I should look into law schools, at least to find out the requirements.    All in all, I think what I'm doing now is good for me - it's making me question what I   should  be doing and what I  could  be doing.  That's never a bad thing, is it?

"I suppose I should have a little more content to justify the massive, page-lengthening links list at right. (Okay, it's not that massive, but it's longer than the lone post.)  I haven't been thinking about much lately, just doing whatever to get through the day. I haven't been sleeping too well either, for some reason. I sleep through the night but I wake up just as exhausted as the night before. This weekend was nice; I slept quite a bit and lazed around at home. Stress-free. Mom and Grandma are visiting Grandpa in Grand Rapids, so I'm just hanging out online for a few more hours. I should make a shopping list and maybe take Grandpa's van to go shopping. I'd rather wait and go with Matt, but he has to mow the lawn and take care of the trash after he's done with his class. And Grandpa just called and said he's got a prescription to be picked up at the pharmacy before 6pm, so I might as well go by myself.  Thinking about this coming school year, too. I'm so anxious to be done, I just want to get Matt's grad school stuff taken care of and move on with our life. I have one theory class to complete a Communications minor, but it's now cancelled for the Fall semester, which means it will be offered during the Winter semester. If I take it then, it will be alongside the theory class I need for my Literature major, and that would make my brain implode (again). So maybe that was just decided for me. As things stand, this fall I'm taking World Novels (Lit), Western Civilization to 1500 (History), Beginning Latin, French 301, and a morning volleyball class for an even 12 credits. I probably could have handled the theory class this fall, or dropped either Western Civ or Latin and volleyball, but we'll see if it's still cancelled by mid-August. I also need to apply for graduation, but my advisor is out of town this summer, so we'll wait until the Fall semester has started.  It's freezing cold in this house. I wish I'd brought a jacket or a sweatshirt. I suppose I could drive home and get either, but meh. I'll survive.

"My first blog.. Man I used to wonder what a blog really is and now am blogging  ;o)  ... I am techie from india (I know nowadays being a techie from India is very dangerous) slogging out ... enjoying myself...But have some serious doubts about certain new things that I am discovering...  Quality  is a wonderful sounding word and my initiation into Project Management exposed me to a world of  jargons, metrics, templates and of course complete non-sense . I know that I may be chided for writing that, but let me clarify. On the set I am a devotee (right word) of the world of mathematics which never ceases to amaze me and Statistics, cos its just wonderful. During one of the great training days, it was conveyed, Statistics shouldn't be employed to misrepresent the data and now I wonder if it is the whole process is to do so. Information is available very abundantly and I guess we have surplus than we can consume. I wonder if generation of information is the basis of quality. Which comes to my first question ? Does adhering to quality standards mean ""keep your common sense @ home and come"". I wonder if the purists of statistics are the ones to satisfy. Cmon.. I wonder what possible information can be derived out of one's coffee breaks, one's mails and definitely the winner, How many lines of code I can dish out ? wonder if they know that I can eternally keep on putting braces, new lines, comments, star, hashes etc and they all contribute to code. Yeah Yeah I know, we have tools that can take care of these, but is this an indicator of a person's ability... Wonder what good is the information for... Begs the second question.. I get the common answer.. information may be useful down the line.. Yes it may be and may not be.. Going by the theory of probability it is equi-probable... I guess quality is used to ensure that the product being manufactured is in accordance with the best-practices in the industry (for starters) and more importantly, you learn from your current process to refine the same.. I think refinement is the catch and I guess it can be done in more than one way than generate some junk metrics..Wonder how the process can be refined from measuring no. of lines dished out in a day... Look forward to people's views... Hey feel free to drop in and drop a line... Hope this blog goes a long way... Time to hit off...

"Today was a regular school day. I got to school and survived through Mr.Perez going on about Jewish law. Then I went to Web Design and watched a pretty interesting video on the history of the internet. After a short break I showed up for Biology and did really good on our quiz. Thats when things started going down hill. When I got into fourth period I had a really bad headache. Then at lunch by the time i got my food it was time to go to class. Spanish and Algebra were easy. Then came AVID. I had to listen to my new AVID teacher talk about how things are going to be different this year. We've been going over this for the past four days. It's getting pretty old. Well after that I came home did my homework and started on this. Thats about everything that happened to me today.

"First off, let me say that English is not my native tongue but I want this to be understood for as much people as possible. So, why ""Old words for a new blog""? Well, the ""new blog"" part is easy: this is the first time that I do something like this. And the ""old words""? That's the reason I'm putting these words here.  Right now I'm in the office. My hands, my fingers, my knees are shaking; I'm lucky of being sit down. I also have a little headache and my stomach hurts bad. Do I have the flu? Nope, but it's because of something as old as the flu: I'm in love.   I admit it, I'm in love with one of my office mates; in fact, she’s my only mate because there's only the two of us here at the offcice. We're completly alone.   I don't wanna tell all the story now from the beginning, I'll do it on another time. Today, I just need to say that she's not in love with me. She hasn't told it that way, but I know it and the knowing of it it's what's killing me deep inside, making me feel really really bad. I don't know words in English to express the pain I'm going thru but I'm sure many of you know what I'm talking about. So you can imagine my situation. She's only a few steps away from me but that distance is an abyss I cannot jump. So close and so far. I wanna reach out and touch her, feel her skin (the smoothest skin ever) but I can't. And I'm dying. That's pretty close to what I'm feeling now; I feel like I'm dying.   Why she didn't tell me that she didn’t feel anything about me?  Why did she let me believe that I had any opportunity with her?

"Ever notice how the end of the school year is both exhilarating and a real let down? I spend an entire year teaching students to be better thinkers, writers, and people, yet only some of this shows through. Your high achievers get better, some of your middle achievers improve, and a lot of students just stay the same.  Behavior is at an all time low at this point too. Since my fifth graders don't have finals, thye've been tuning me out for the last three weeks. It's terrible. Although there is little I can do about it, I just hope that something of the knowledge and behavior skills that I taught remain with them. Maybe my modeling good behavior might just rub off on them in the long run. Who knows? Anyway, it has been a long year and I am ready for it to end. Thank God it ends next week!

"I've never been good at keeping a diary, so this may not work out so well.  Today after work, I had a surprise in that Jeff had called and left me a message on my cell phone.  I was very skeptical of ever hearing from him again.  I still do not know what happened over graduation weekend to cause the complete lack of communication between us recently.  I guess at some level I knew that we would never be able to work things out with 800 miles between us.  I was dreaming for a little bit.  I do believe things happen for a reason, however.  I just wish I could figure out the reason for having met James at this time in my life.  It's almost scary how perfect he is for me.  We have the same stupid sense of humor and understand each other perfectly.  I can't imagine him ever being an asshole or us ever staying mad at each other.  Why does he have to move to Texas in 6 weeks?  Long distance just isn't my thing.  So once again, I will get my heart broken and recover only to move on and get it broken again.  Which I guess is the way I prefer it.  I'm too young to settle down with one man.  I just wish I would quit meeting these incredible guys at such wrong times.   When am I going to get a break in love?    On the good side, I had a fabulous weekend.  I am beginning to love my new home here.  The possibilities are endless in this area.  I am making friends and figuring my way around.  Work is good...much better than I had thought it could be.  I guess I am a true geek at heart...who would have known?  I still don't think I could live here for the rest of my life though and be happy.  I think this is a great stepping stone though for 4 or 5 years.  Then it will be off to bigger and better things for me.  Maybe I'll move back home.  Or maybe to Texas... :)  who knows.  I love that I have so many choices in my life.  I really do feel very fortunate to have had all the opportunities in my life that have happened lately.  Life is good.

"Almost everyone I know online is saying BLOG. What is it I ask and after reading a few from those I know, I learned that it’s an open journal; that almost everyone online can read. “But why, isn’t a journal supposed to be private?” I asked. Some say that they want their life to be an open book and others may say “well I don’t really post everything that happened.” Still, I am a bit off with this.  So in order to know more of this, I decided to make my own so I may experience and learn about this thing called blog. This will be something from what I do and I don’t know what will happen.

"What a whirlwind! My first trip since I've decided to try travel writing. I got a few articles started: one on dogs in Paris and another on a single woman's trip to paris (that would be me).

"I can't believe how hung over I feel today. Yet, not an ounce of booze has touched these lips. I think that it was the coming off of travel and the lack of sleep. It almost makes me giggle, that this same feeling of apathy, stomach turning and headache can be caused by something other than beer. It's also an emotional hang over of sorts. I suppose it is the factor that I was just feeling so much yesterday...But I did not want to feel...At least not on the inside. I miss sensory feeling. I think that I have closed myself off so much from the world that I have protected myself both emotionaly and physicaly. I think that the phyiscal ramifications come first...it's much easier to lie to your head than to your physical self. I truly don't really know what I'm talking about.

"Well...I could start this with ""who I am"" and ""why I am here"", blah, blah, blah.  But I will save that for another day.  I am an online diary/blog veteren so to speak.  I am starting a new one because too many people know me at the other one (I really think that in my cyber-saturated mind. How could they know me?  We've never met.)  Dammit I am going to be honest in this one, no playing for the audience.  I will warn you that I tend the blah, blah on about the negative.  So don't leave me posts about my damn negativity.  This is my house and my toys, go home if you don't like it.  And I am just going to start in the middle here so it probably will leave you saying HUH??             So Dan gets the car loan with grandma as the co-signer.  Then like 2 seconds later he decides to quit his job and move to Detroit and go to school.  Not a popular thing to do, and I agree.  He does have a new job lined up.  But him moving away and such gets grandma pretty nervous.  Fast forward to today....Sissy...I mean Mark (professional mamas boy) wants to come over and hang out with Brian.  I get home from work and he is already here...fabulous.  He's in the house maybe 15 minutes and he starts sticking his sissy boy nose into the Dan/Grandma/Car/Detroit business.  NONE OF HIS BUSINESS.  After a short time of this blah, blah I leave to room.  I want to keep myself from choking my brother in law....  ""Well my thing is....."" he says.  MY THING?  You don't have a thing...this isn't your thing.  Brian comes looking for me a little later after he got rid of Sissy.  He new exactly why I left the room (that why we are married 8-)).  He told sissy in no uncertain terms that if he came over to spy for his mother he might as well go home.   In fact (don't know what  happened to the freaking font), he told him they had better drop it before he said something he would regret later and told him (Sissy) that he (Brian) can handle Dan and life at our house without his advice.  GO BRIAN!        So thats today.      Hope I get back here....hope I can find it.             peace

"Where does one start?? I guess by telling a bit about who I am, where I have been and where I hope to go.  I live in Northern California in a little community called Yankee Hill. We are situated between the towns (cities??) of Chico and Oroville about 80 miles north of Sacramento. I live on 10 beautiful acres where I bring dogs I rescue from the pound (no sweet sounding titles like ""Animal Shelter"" here!!) and train them to work with people with disabilities.  One February 20th of 2004, we placed our programs first Service Dog to work with a young girl with Cerebral Palsy. It was a really exciting event and after following up on them for the past 3 months, they are doing really great.   I am now working with 3 other dogs. One is being trained to work as a the ears for a hard-of-hearing person who also seems to be picking up the tasks needed to assist someone in a wheelchair. Her name is Polly and we believe that she is a mix of German Shepherd and Yellow Lab.  Starr is a Black Lab mix and she is being trained to assist someone with a wheelchair. Her progress seems to be slower, but I am still hoping that she will pass the program. If not, we will find her a good home as a pet or possibly keep her to be our demonstration dog. The only real problem with her is that she is not real confident in big city environments. She is about 15 months old, so there is still time to help her overcome her issues.  Then we have Mocha, a Chocolate Lab. We chose her for a specific client who has a spinal condition that is making it progressively harder for him to walk on his own. Mocha is being trained to wear a harness with a handle that he can hang onto and offer him balance and stability. We have only been working with her for a couple months. She also has had some issues for us to help resolve, the most major is a fear of having either her ears or tail touched as if she was picked up by them at some time. The other is that she has had a hard time staying in one place when someone moves near her. Both of these things are being addressed and we are having great success with her developing more confidence in a variety of situations.  Well, that is a start. I'll stop here and see how this looks and pick it up again later this evening. TA TA

After coming home my madre informed me that Orlando would not be coming home this weekend because he had something to do in Bristol.  I do understand that this is a new life both exciting and adventurous, but I also understand the pain I experienced when realizing I would not see him for another week.  I knew this wouldn't be easy, it just sucks.  There are beautiful, sophisticated girls there and I am some simpleton with which there lies no mystery or intrigue.  I am old, boring and worn out.   Also, I know that I am a bit too dramatic and am making this situation sound much worse than it is, but heck, this is a journal for me right?  I can say whatever the hell I want to!  I really want Orlando to follow his heart and if he wants to participate in anything he can go for it.  I want him to enjoy college, experience new things and have fun...I just miss him...that's all.  I love Orlando.

"In this process of letting go, I am finding that the most courageous act I can to is to also  let in . Change is the only constant in life, but it never seems to get any easier to move beyond the attachments of my heart and head.   I find that sharing my stories is a part of my process of healing.  It provides release, but also accountability.  In a way, this log is a letter to my future self; a reminder; a chronicalling.    Taylor and I have broken up more times in the past 9 years than I can even begin to count, and in recent years those endings have been becoming more and more final, as we sought other loves and different paths.  But we always seemed to find our way back to each other again.   This time there is a sense of finality.  Despite our best efforts, we just can't seem to move beyond our struggles.  It is heartbreaking to think of leaving behind my best friend and all of the dreams we shared for our future, but it is also exciting to think of the possibilities life has in store for us.    I take solace in the small things...  Puddle jumping on my way to the corner market this morning Birds enjoying all of their new baths after the rains last night Kids in a single file line on their way to a field trip  I am seeking new adventures: meeting new people, exploring new places, new things.... Letting in and  taking in   the world with a new perspective, a lightness, an openess.   The past 3 years have brought a lot of loss and lessons.  I have had to mourn my grandparents for the second time as the dome was sold.  I had to let go of Taylor to be with Mark, who brought a lot of joy, but even more heartache, and then regret that I had hurt Taylor to pursue such a fruitless endeavor.   I have always tried to follow my heart at any given moment, and sometimes the choices that follow are painstakingly difficult.  I can't help but feel that some of those choices have contributed to these insurmountable trials between Taylor and I.  He moved on long ago.    And now I must begin to.    I have learned so much in the last few years; about love and life, and mostly about myself.   I live my life with the faith that everything happens just as it is meant to. I must trust the unfolding, let go, and let in.

"Tonight was a momentous night. Apologies to Kelly Holmes, but while she was achieving her dream of olympic gold my mind was elsewhere. At just about the same time my daughter Ellie took three teetering first steps and our house errupted in a state ot total euphoria. In the seconds following the great event Ellie lost her focus and tumbled towards the ground, only to be swept up in a bear hug and given another chance. We weren't disappointed that Ellie only managed three steps, or even that she fell. Her triumphant grin and clapping hands were enough to melt the coldest of hearts. I can't help but wonder if God ever feels the same way about me. Maybe sometimes I focus too much on the end result and not enough on the joy of having a God who is there when I throw myself on Him in an attempt to do something I could never do without Him. I think next time something doesn't go my way I might try to take a leaf out of Ellie's book. Perhaps I'll clap my hands, grin triumphantly and try again, realising that a little progress can be a pretty big deal. And to Kelly Holmes mother..... I think I know how you feel!!!

"Again, Not a lot happened to me today. It started off regularly, showered,got dressed, ate and so forth. Then I decided to play MSN before I went to school. I saw that Kendra was on so we talked about the hot gossip in town... it was mainly about the Jarret and Sarah and their new found love. I got to school abit on the late side, but I just had Bio so I didn't give a damn. Then we skip ahead to 3:15, because school is gay and I don't want to talk about it. I really felt like doing something after school just because I didn't want to go home. But everyone was preoccupied so I had no other choice but to go home. I then decided I would go for a drive to kill some time. So I'm driving down main when I see a group of hutterites trying to cross the street. They were already almost half way across when I started slowing down. When they saw me, it was as if I was the Anti-Christ. All 4 of them just start scrambling around. They looked like fucking retards out there. So 2 head back for safety and infront of the Co-op and the other 2 bravely take the risk and proceed to the other side. I was so close to rolling down my window and start yelling at the the retards...Fuckers   That was the most exciting thing that happened to me today.   Then I went over to the school to see what Big K was up to. He was doing some stupid accounting shit with Connie. He asked me to go get his pictures from the Parasave for him. So I did that, then I went over to Radio Shack to see what was new there. Mitch was there but he was TOO BUSY TO TAlk...So I once again left. After about other 5 minutes of driving I got bored and went home. The rest of my night was then followed by, eating, MSN, then homework.   That pretty much sums it all up. I am tired now and ready for bed. Later

I never, ever intended to fall in love or to let emotion get involved. I mean, how taboo is it to see a married man? However, when the said couple is poly....I mean, why not? He says he can love me and love Megan too, and that he isn't going anywhere. So I'm just going to have fun, enjoy the ride for as long as it lasts, and hopefully, learn from the experiences. Regardless, I love him. It's been a long time since I felt love for a man. It's hard to admit to myself, but I do want him, and to a certain extent, maybe I even think that I need him. There is some connection there that I can't put my finger on. I've no idea what it is...maybe a past life or something.  Anyway, onto the doctor callings I go.

"This is my first post so bear with me.  I want to start by saying that I love life, I just think that sometimes people are delt a messed up hand.  Why can't some of us have some happiness sometime. I have a wonderful son that I thank GOD for everyday.  He is truely the light of my life.  When I found out that I was pregnant  I worried ""what am I going to do with a kid?"", now I wonder what I ever done without him.  If somthing ever happened to my son I would die. With that said I want to know why am I so sad?   I failed at being a wife. (I only got married because I was pregnant and thought it was the right thing to do. there was no love involved). I wonder if I ever will fall in love.  Who knows maybe one day.   I just hate the weeks that my son is at his dads becouse those weeks are very hard to get through, not that anyone cares anyway.

"I have started a Mel Brooks guild on gaia. So far it only has three members(including me) but what should I expect? Overall, so far so good.  The only prior experiance I've had with guilds(or any sort of online roleplay thing) is Neopets.  I remember starting out at Neopets....it was one of the last days of school during 6th grade...my friend Heather introduced it to me. I became instantly hooked to it(and so did anyone else I convinced to join, lol)  I wasted more than three years of my life there....and I've had at least six seperate accounts, on two diffrent e-mail adresses.(if you want one, PM me on gaia and we'll work out some sort of deal, I'm on a quest and I don't feel like giving anything away for free, lol)  Over time, things got a bit tedious and dull. For those of you reading this and are on Neopets, you know what I mean. You have to play their stupid flash games in order to gain neopoints(their currency) and I just don't have the patience for that anymore. Inflation, one of the negitive aspects of most economies, had gotten extremely high, so items became difficult to afford. So eventually, I just gave up. That, and I outgrew their whole 'kiddie' image.  Now about the guilds....I had created at least 10 or more guilds on that site, and the members almost always consisted of the friends in my seventh grade classes. Boy, I was glad they were around. Hell, I still talk to a couple of them on gaia.  ......wow this was long and pointless...perhaps I should continue with this tommorow, ne?

"It started off as a fine day. Got up early, came to work. As usual, my PC would give me some slight problems, but after a while, it would be okay.  New colleague really giving me lots of headache. Taught him thousand and one things and all he can remember is only 0.01% of everything. This is a real saddening case. Wish that I can just fire him and save my hair from turning all white.  Half hour to lunch. Wonder what's there to eat? Let's hope no more LG1 food. Getting sick and tired of the food there. Making me shirt and etc stink like crazy.  Toothache seriously aching like crazy now. Must see doc. Most probably, whole tooth will have to come out. Damn.  Phones also giving problem. LCD problem. aiii. Why do these LCDs always give humongous problems? Really cannot stand it already. Everytime an LCD fails, it stays in the workshop for dunno how long.  KTMB also another one. Giving problems like nobody's business. Wanna give them busines, they dun wan. Real tired of them already. Called them dunno how long, they dun answer. :( Hope they reply my sms.  After work, had a great time. Jessy called. We just talked about everything and anything. She was at the pasar malam. Then I told her that I'll call her right after she gets back. I did.   We talked and talked and talked for 2 hours and 30 minutes. We are just normal friends. We talked bout unique names for her kids (Zanique, Danielle, Cyclice / Celynn) and she commented a few for me (I Lai, He Lai, She Lai, They Lai, We Lai, It Lai). Both of us were just plain talking. It's hard to find someone that you can click to in just a short while. Plus, we did more than just click. We were close, quite close friends already.  Her boyfriend's coming back tomorrow. She must be really happy. Can tell from the tone on her voice.   Well, that's all for today. See ya.

My grandmother is in the hospital again. she's been puking and having dizzy spells, and the doctors don't know exactly what's wrong with her. so much for modern technology.  Read the  Da Vinci Code  by Dan Brown. interesting book. it argues that Jesus was not divine, and that the church invented his divinity. Also argues that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene. well i'm not going to go in depth to argue anything, but i think Dan Brown made lots of mistakes in his assumptions. for example, he writes that Peter was the one in the picture "" The Last Supper "" who was making threatening gestures. apparently that man is Judas Iscariot, not Simon Peter. that explains a lot about the hand gestures.  Anyways, there's a reason why the book is under the fiction section in book shops and libraries.  Thinking of getting a new cpu.  Thinking of you, too.  Bye all.

So last thursday i got back from the JH Pendleton YLC  ...damn it was boring. despuite the boredom i did learn a thing or two about the American way. As you may know  ive been working on a few songs lately ( each of which is dedicated to a friend) and  ive kind of quit  on the funeral one and am at a roadblock  for Haleigh's. Ive completely changed everything about the one dedicated to Herumi. the lyrics are that of a lovesick ballad and instead of guitar and back up instruments, it is solely piano, but rather simplistic. strangely  i consider it my best love song  ive written and the irony is that the girl to whom i am writing it(Herumi) is not even my GF. i think i shall alter haleigh's as well. i guess the problem is that everything about it is too complicated...that damn solo.   despite my end of summer blues i do feel strangely enthusiastic about the upcoming schoolyear. maybe ill meet a nice, pretty, sweet, academically inclined girl whose innocence accentuates her natural beauty...but also strong..like it would take more than one bullet to stop her. it would also be cool if she knew how to play an instrument or knew carpentry or steel welding. damn..maybe  i should find a girl who works at home depot. Eh screw it, my two loves as of now are school and Rock n Roll..GO ABSTINENCE!  k so ive been saving up for a sniper air rifle. i shall get it soon. i cant wait to kill that damn crow terrorizing my dog. i swear i will shoot that things head clean off it neck.  well now i am off to the 32nd street Naval Exchange to get some new clothes.

"I did my first real ride on the new frame during my commute home from work last night. I may need a new cassette, but I need to do some diagnostics before I throw money at the problem. My chain is slipping in the 21,19,and 18 cogs. The chain is new, of course, but the cassette only has twenty hours on it at best. I replaced my front inner chain ring after we built the frame up. It was worn slap out and you couldn't turn the pedals with any pressure without the chain jumping around like a lap dog.      My left knee was sore just under the cap and my hamstrings were aching during the ride in to the shop this a.m. I suspect my seat may need to come up a couple of millimeters, but the fit-stick says things are dead-on. If there is anything the past has taught me, it's not to monkey around with my position at the first sign of discomfort.      Ava and I made a ""tent"" with a bed sheet and two chairs last night. We huddled underneath while I read her favorite books.  I was supposed to go to my writer's group last night, but I stayed and spent time with Ava instead.  Typing it all up now gives me time to reflect on it and while last night I resented not going to the group (just a bit), this morning I know that April, Ava, and I are all better for me being home as much as possible. Ape lets me ride more than most wives, I'd imagine, so it's hard for me to complain at all.

Shadow them . which meant we would have to observe them going about doing their job. this whole exercise was to be completed in a span of 7 hours and also required us not to spend any money on any form of hired aomutation , which would now mean that we would have to go about the entire city (which means many corporates)..Hitch hiking.  with initial few hitches we all ultimately were off to our vaguely targetted destinations. i chose to go to the office of the Daimler Chrystler india situated at the farthest end off the city.i managed to reach the destination by hitch hiking  snd managing some how.aafrom then it was smooth sailing as i have my brother in law working with D.C. India . upon entering the office of D C India i was interoduced to two of the German executives on deputation from germany i had a 1 hour session with him as far as shadowing is concerned it was a complete no no with DC India as they said it was not a company policy to allow any such activity . all set and done by the end of it all i managed to reach my B school campus on time .    we then had a session with our teacher to discuss the procedings of the day . it was a wonderful learning experience and i would cherish this experience for times to come.

"i was just watching apocalypse now and ive realised that napalm is your friend, your very best friend, and she will care for you- she just wants your soul first, here's how to make her:  the last time i made it, mine was very basic- 1 part gasoline to 2 parts animal blood. This solidified into a type of gel, not very stable ( a bit like me) but lethally flammable and sticky.  But a revised method is to pour some gasoline into an old container and force it to eat up styrofoam-you can even use the little white balls from the inside of a bean bag- untill it wont take anymore, this dries into a form of foam itself, with a wet slice at the bottom, tie some into a soggy ball and wrap with cling film to seal it and you have a perfect pocket rocket for throwing into a car window or something else that wants to burn, you could even hook up a basic fuse into it and run away, very fast indeed, because if you have tied the cling film on tightly enough it will just explode big time, superb.

"Last night Jerry Douglas came to town and played a free concert. That guy is SO GOOD. He made me want to learn to play the dobro. And the best part was that his fiddle player had a mohawk. It was kind of like the whole band was saying, ""Even though we play bluegrass instruments, we're WAY beyond bluegrass."" They even had the same bass player as Nickel Creek. I wonder if that guy goes around joining bluegrass bands and then turning them into non-bluegrass bands. Or maybe in this case it was Jerry's idea. Maybe he got too sick of bluegrass from playing with Alison Krauss. Well it was a really great concert, nonetheless.

"Heather and I have spent the last two weekends at weddings and over 27 hours in the car. Suprisingly we did not kill each other and got along fine.  It was a little nerve racking to perform Jessica' s wedding but it was an honor to do it. I just didn't want to screw up the day she would remember forever.      Heather is doing well since she has moved here. She has already found a job that I think she will enjoy. She is going through training right now so she is not really getting to do her actual thing yet. She is working at Church's Home for Children and will be working with kids around the 8-12 age.  She will do and excellent job.   We have officially started the wedding plans. This past Sunday we went to Guest Island Ranch in Ames to see if we could have our reception or rehearsal dinner there. It was pretty interesting especially with my overdramatic dad there.   We liked it a lot and to be honest there are not a large number of options.  So we will see on how it goes. Be praying that we can plan a fun wedding but one that is reasonable and cheap. Anyway it will be good to hear how everyone is doing.  Jake  Here is a pic of us in Germany

"So, it is Friday. I am at work hoping that I am successfully pretending to be working. I do hope it works. My current job is easy to spot. Just go to  urlLink Pravda.sk  and a lot of what you see is a result of my clicking and typing. Yes, you've guessed it right. I am an online journalist surfing the news agencies for the fresh news that I may together with my co-workers offer to the hungry Slovak online audience.   Today is one especially dull day as Fridays often are. So I watch the bubbles bubbling in my mineral water bottle on my desk. It is quite relaxing, but it makes me want to pee too often. That is the price you pay.  Fridays are often filled with expectations of the coming weekend, but not today. See the rason:  The forecast forecasts forbiddingly nasty stormy rainy ugly weather.   That would not worry me too much, but it has been so nice and hot during the working days when I just had to sit here and satisfy the hunger for the news of several thousands of people. Oh well, I should better be going... read you later.

Then when I got home, after about 30 min of sitting and watching t.v., my dad wanted me to cut the grass. So I had to do that, took me about 45 min and during that time, my friend Andy called. Went over to his house after I was done. Played some 21 and some smackdown for ps2. When I came home, my mom and I went to pick up some mcdonalds. My mom got a big mac which had a free download code for www.connection.com. Got a free music download, along with one that Andy gave to me cause he got one from his work for free. He happens to work for mcdonalds too. When I got done with that, I came online and sat around watching t.v. like I am doing right now. :) another fun day.

I was like tired, because I had like stayed up till 3 am trying to fix my damn ghetto computer. I made something for them to eat, but one of them didn't want to eat. I got so pissed and I made her eat. She ate it and everything went fine. Then I decided to fix my computer and I tried installing another version of XP on it. It almost broke down. I was so totally freaked out! I mean god damn! Then Thomas had to call and I had to go over to Sloan's house cause he just got a multi tap. (like I cared if i he just got one!). Well I went anywayz and had a really lame time. I am not really good at video games, I mean fighting games. We then played an NBA game and I totally sucked at it. I suck at the real thing, what makes them think that I could play a fake version? When I got home, my computer was fixed and I was happy. But then I had to defrag it and I was pissed. Then I went to the upstairs computer and I started to type in my blog! I had to fix the internet connection first. While typing this, the TV said that Linkin Park has a new video coming out and it is one of my favorite songs. ""breaking the habit"" and there is a making the video at 6 pm tomorrow (i think) and I am totally psyched that they have a new video! So now i feel bored.  OMG it is a linkin park video and i am totally wanting to watch it, damn, my mom turnt it away! DARN!! Well, i dont like that vid much anyways. I have to defrag this computer now, S'later pplz!

I don't think I'm on the top of peoples lists right now. When the others get on their school break, they're off to Poland which shall leave me here, back to square one. But, so I hope, when they return a real summer shall commence. [I can only keep my fingers crossed so much]. V gets back from work this evening, but I doubt I'll be seeing him if he gets back in the early hours. I guess next week will be spent in a coffee shop, drinking soft drinks and a cigarette in one hand - as per...  I don't know why I have such  great expectations of the Summer. I think it all stems from the Green days - when I was Mr. Popular. Well, so it seemed. Then that faded out and I was left with another lot of people...now im just hoping that doesn't fade out. I don't think it will.  But, there is a new prospect ahead of me, a'course. New school, new people, new faces, new opportunites blah x 3. Things are going to be new, and, perhaps my past will fade out, but there's something ahead afterwards. How mnelodramatic. Today, I shall do nothing.

"I'm bored but strangly happy today. I did nothing today (except workout) and it was awesome. My color is Copper and I taste like honey. I like that; better than tasting like copper. Honey is sweet, so I think it fits me well; however it is also sticky and annoying. I shall ignore those attributes of the honeyness. But honey is pretty...and well, we've been over that before. And if you don't know what pretty is, pretty = hot. I know, I know; it's all very confusing. Just know that when a girl calls you pretty, its not that bad of a thing (Most of the time). My alarm clock just went off...how odd.  Julia called again, dont really want to talk to her. She and Crystal came out on Friday after the Fair fiasco. I went to Tiffany to escape them. I prolly would have had a VERY VERY good time, but I don't want to have the pressure of that looming over my head, should I decide to never speak to them again. Sure, Im not going to turn it down if its  right there , but with both of them here it would have been weird. Don't ask why, it just would have. Tiff says Im turning into a man slut. I disagree.  If these are the best years of our lives, I'm-a-thinking preimptive suicide may not be such a bad idea. I mean, just cut off the pain early, ya know? Nah, I wouldnt ever do anything like that, but it is an interesting theory. I do like to get things done early and death is a thing. heh. Don't know where this is going, but thats whats kinda cool. I think this is better than a Xanga. Kody's profile says that no one cares what I do all day. Well, shit,  I  don't care what I do all day. These aren't really for others to read, I mean they are, but they aren't. I see them as more of an outlet; for me atleast. I need money and I need alot of it. If I had money chicks would dig me. They would, they would. I need money, a cool hair cut and leather jacket. Hell, I wanna be The Fonze. He's one cool nigga. He can walk into a room, get some kickass music playin, some sweet chicks and get free food. Yeah, I wanna be the Fonze. Well, Im all out of brain power.   Copper / Honey , Out.

"Hoss is my bulldog (for anyone that sees this but doesn't know me), and he is a spoiled one at that. This how we have found him when we came home on several occasions. You can't see it in the picture, but there was a Corona on the railing and his daddy was grilling hamburgers for us...including him.  I wonder what he does that we don't see...maybe I don't want to know, eh?  Anyway, he does weigh at least 62 lbs here. He still thinks he's small enough to be a lap dog, and will climb up in my lap every time he gets tired just to prove it. Of course, at that point I am pinned and have to move a mountain to get up out of the chair. But he has more kisses than I can stand sometimes, and plenty left over for anyone that comes to visit.  I'm definitely a Bulldogger!

I mean who really puts on their CV, 'Ah yes, that's me. I sang in the Felix Catfood jingle.' ??? Also, I don't like Bush. At all. And I don't like Micheal Jackson because he has a dead nose and sings like a sick hippo. There are lots of things I do like though. I like melted mozerella, the number 666 - just a random thought but if there is an apocolypse, wouldn't it happen on 06/06/06? Just a random vibe - and I like redheads. I love shopping. Shoe shopping. But I hate French keyboards and porridge. I think that is enough randomness for now. More later. Tash P.S.

That would be my girlfriend *hears in the background “awww...”*.  Anyways, from the time I last posted, not much has happened.  On Wednesday, I got pulled over by a cop on my Vino Scooter(which in VA doesn’t require a license), he pulled me over and asked for my ID, which I readily supplied; he looke it over and said he had no problem with me.  He then proceded to say that he’s had complaints about mopeds in the area(a motoscooter is classified as a moped here) and he also wanted to warn me about a new law passed a few days ago requiring all moped drivers to carry an ID with Name, Address, and Birthdate.  I said ok and sped off on my merry way.  I wouldn’t have had so much trouble with him if he hadn’t blared his siren at me.  Anyways, on Saturday, I went to Tyson’s Corner Mall(The local really expensive mall) for about half a day.  I went up and was going to go to a few classes at the Apple Store.  I attended half of one and the others never happened.  No real big deal for me, but I really wanted to attend those, and now I will never have the chance *sniff*.  Ah well, such is life.

However I wasn't bore enough to name them. Even thought I feel that they needed names. About an hour into endless staring I notice stuff are flying across the sky. They look like tracer rounds. I was like wow we are under attack. But hmm.... they look like they are 300 miles up in the air. Than I was like well they are shooting no were need us so I just watch the growing stuff flying 300 mile over me for 3 more hours. By the way I did see few huge growing flying stuff fly across the sky. That could of be a missile or a meteor burst. If its a meteor I am going to name it ""shooting cock shit"".

So i had to go and park half a mile down the road  and run to their house in the flood...and ya i know im dumb but i wore those really cheap old navy sandals and well lemme tell ya... you cant run in themm...especailly if theyre wet...ya basically im saying that i fell on the way there but i eventually got there and it was packed out... but the food was good and the people were cool so i had fun for the most part until i discovered the chips and hot sauce...IT WAS SOOO good...i loved it..it just set ur mouth on FIYYYAA  but not too much and ya it was goodddd. So you would probably think thats a good thing but i was chilln upSTAIRS and so i'd have to go up n down em to get more...well so i run outta chips and so i get up to go down for more and im headin down the stairs and i catch glance of this amazingly hott girl(not sayin who) and well i guess i lost focus for a second cuz my hand with the plate of hot sauce hit the side rail and i missd a step and ya the plate toppled all over the white carpeted stairs... and all over mrs. stark who was sitting on them for some reason?? so ya it was embarrasing...especially asking mrs duffie for something to clean it up with... mrs stark wasnt mad..PHEW and it ended up bein alrite besides the embarrassment...so basically the moral of the story is Never NEVER eat the hot sauce at those so called ""GRAD PARTIES"". just don't...its not worth the risk...the RUSH is only for a second...but the consequences they never go away...so DONT...Do...GRAD Hot SAuce...       THE MORE YOU KNOW...

"Just last night I was watching the news and the headlines said that the man who was running the government in Iraq is dead. Assassinated by a bomb. Someone said to me after hearing that 'Well, Iraq's not going to go away in a hurry!' I want it to go away and leave me to my life.  You've gotta wonder what goes through the head of someone just before their car explodes.

"""Marriage, Marriage is what brings us together, today."" -- The Princess Bride      Women can be frustrating. My girlfriend and I just had a very important discussion two weeks ago about getting married. She then left to go on vacation for two weeks with her family. Since she leff, I keep thinking that she will say she doesn't love me and doesn't want to marry me. I've told her I love her and that I want to marry her but haven't yet proposed.      She is the type that likes to know all about what's going to happen before it happens. So she asked me all about the future and what I think about when we should get married and what will happen after that. I told her I want to marry her in December. She objects because she is a school teacher (like me)and that is a busy time of year. I'm okay with doing it another time (like June) but I love her so much and want to begin my life with her right now.      Anyway, I'm ultimately worried that she will get scared and run away. But I'm probably being stupid and untrusting. She cares very much for me and I know that for sure, so I should just be content with that.

"So alot of weird shit has been happening to me lately. For some reason, a reason which ill-ludes me, I can not seem to have a normal everyday boring relationship. There always seems to be some kind of drama or opstical. One of my more intelligent female friends seems to think it's because I don't choose the right kind of women, i should remind her that there aren't many women out in the world like her. Well if anyone has any tips on what is the right kind of women, I'm open to suggestions. Maybe it's that I just don't know what I want. I suppose when one thinks about it, my issues aren't that different then anyone elses but that doesn't help me feel like i'm not alone in this deal. I guess when it comes to these situations, in the end we are all really just alone in a crowd...

"I haven't written any diaries or any other sort of it for a long time.. Not since my last relationship was over a year ago.. But the pain and hurt and unsecurity I feel right now are just too much for me.. It's been overloading and ready to explode.. I need to let it out somehow.. I just can't let it out to the person that actually needs to hear it most..  I don't understand why I'm always in this kind of relationship over and over again.. Why am I always with a man that has no future.. It's always ""no hope-no risk-no commitment"". I don't choose whom I fall in love with.. But it's always men like them..  The man I'm with now is the perfect example of my stupidity.. He's younger than me, we have nothing in common, he's too goodlooking, and not ready for a serious relationship.. I knew that from the very beginning. But somehow, I still let myself to fall in love with him. Why the hell would I do that? Doesn't my brain tell my heart what to do? Is there no connection at all between them?  I've trying to give this man everything.. I thought somehow I would melt his heart and make him fall in love with me.. Oh, I sound so pathetic now.. But now, after 9 months together.. Nothing has changed.. He's still and will never be the man I want him to be.. He make me feel so unsecure.. Especially when it comes to other women. I'm a jealous girl.. He knows that. And it doesn't stop him to get in touch with hix ex's, keep their pictures in his laptop, looking at other girls when he's with me, cooking for other girls and invite them to come over.. If he already has me, why would he do that, right? And what the hell am I doing with him until 9 months? I can't walk away from him.. I wish he copuld change someday.. Somehow.. I don't understand why he's doing this to me.. Does he realize how much he hurt me?  I don't know why I'm typing this.. I should be talking to him no and break up with him.. It would be so much easier if there's no love. I don't want to lose him but it's killing me everyday from all the pain he cause me..  The answer to my problem is so clear. Why can't I just take it? What's wrong with me?

"Being really bored again... I shall post.    Yesterday I went on a date with Elise. We went to see King Arthur. The theatre was nearly empty because it was 4pm on a Tuesday, but these two fat men sat a seat away from us. I think I counted 7 other people in the whole theatre. Not to mention one of these guys got on his cell phone for about 30 minutes. HOLY SHIT!!! I swear, some people need to be shot. Anyways, after the movie we sat in the parking lot debating about where to eat. Of course Elise refused to contribute, except for places within eyesight, so I had to choose. We finally went to Orlando's  where we proceded to eat overpriced (but very very good)  food. Afterwards we went to Elise's mom's house cuz her mom had made a chocalate cake. I stayed for about an hour then went home. I would have stayed longer, but I didnt want to overstay my welcome (especially since I havent been there in quite some time). All in all, I think the whole thing went pretty good.   Today I woke up at noon, which I HATE doing, but I was so tired. Yesterday I had to wake up really early to take Olivia to someone's house cuz my dad was going out of town. He goes out of town almost every week for his job. Olivia goes over to one of my dad's friend's house so I dont have to be chained down watching her. There are 4 other kids there which she gets along with fairly well, but she always wants to come home. Go figure. Our house is so boring.   Well, I gotta go figure out what to make for dinner. I didnt plan on Olivia being home so everything is frozen. Dinner should be interesting tonight.

"Alright, this is my first Blog post. So, I guess i'll write about what happened today. Well, just like the res of this week, I went to sleep at 4a.m. thanks to my damn headaches. So, I missed school, again. I supposed it can't be helped with all my damn problems, and the operation I had last week but anyway.   I got exams next week! Not good, I only started studying an hour ago, and the exam's on Monday. Of course, i've always been one to procrastinate with my work and studying, it's just that now I have an excuse as to why i'm going to fail! Sigh!   This weirdo called ""Yen-Po"" wants to come to my house. He's this weird homosexual with alot of issues. I'm not sure I want to see him because he said he ""wants to see me"" which conjures up some pretty vivid images in my sick little mind.   I had a really weird dream last night. I was at the cinema, eating popcorn. Out of no where i'm sleeping in a bed with some weirdo and they are holding a cane. At that point I woke up, and then when I went back to sleep I had rather enjoyable dreams about my school, and how I was causing it mass destruction. Ahh, the joys of an unconcious mind.

"It has been crazy getting here, as I started this journey on 24th April. I have just started working again last week. I set off late on Saturday with my pick-up truck and a U-Haul trailer full of all my stuff and made it to Arizona (2415 miles) in 3 days. The truck then promptly broke down 70 miles away from my cousin’s house! What are the chances of driving that far and then it packing up on her doorstep?   After 2 weeks the mechanics at the garage managed to figure out the computer had gone on the truck and that is why it had stopped which would have been great if it had not been the air sensor that was the problem. Although I did get to do some of the best mountain biking of my life in a place call Sedona, AZ so who cares?!   With the truck still out of action, I was forced to ride to California on my Triumph 955i motorcycle, through some of the best desert roads on the planet - life is hard sometimes! When I got to California, Scott a friend of mine put me up in his house in Orange County, which was very cool of him as I stayed there for 3 weeks and he never once complained about the smell. I had a copious amount of job interviews during this time and was offered a number of them, but in the end I have gone back to working for Rentokil-Initial for the third time!   Therefore, with a few weeks to kill before I was due to start working again, I went off for a ride on the Triumph up through the mountains of California to Lake Tahoe. Tahoe is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen and well worth a visit if you are ever out this way. I then rode back down through the deserts of Nevada past Area 51 and Death Valley to Las Vegas and back to my cousin’s house in Arizona. It was good to relax, do some camping, laugh and point at fat Americans and take some time out.    So I am now back to working in the Tropical Plants Division, selling plant services (selling flowers in San Francisco may sound a little gay to you and to be far it is!!).   I am happy out here in San Jose, it is incredible. It has a wonderful climate, is close to the sea and mountains, San Francisco is also really close and Lake Tahoe is only 3 hours away for some great snowboarding!! I am so happy to be out of New York!  Thanks for visiting my blogger!  Ian

One thing being why I feel depressed and why I get irritate easily. I've discovered that when I'm not with a crowd of people I don't feel depressed or get irritate easily.

"Well for someone with an abundance of thoughts spilling out of her head, I'm having difficulty committing to writing them down. Maybe it's the heat, as we usually experience a much shorter summer . It's not as green and lush here as in previous summers. This global warming isn't just talk.      People are coming and going in my household. My youngest son Kevin has just returned from his week long summer camp. I was abit horrified to find that he had certainly packed along a visually controversial book for a christian based camp. I'm glad they didn't find it in his possession. They might've freaked out just looking at it, (Diablo, legacy of blood). He's almost fourteen and plays Diablo on the computer all the time. It looks like a skeletal grim reaper on the cover of it. Ahh, the joys of a young teenage boy. The sounds of his drumkit pounding on a summer's day, with our windows open for the neighbourhood to enjoy. The young teenage 'friend that is a girl' that comes to call, all giggles and cute.      My 'middle child', Kimberly, now twenty and working hard is two weeks away from flying back east to start her third year of university in Toronto. The anguish she'll experience to leave her boyfriend behind, once again. Been there, done that, but what does a Mom know. I think she's got it made, with her girlfriend in a great apartment downtown Toronto. Two girls going to school and experiencing life in a big city. Wish I had that opportunity at that age. What's the rush for commitment? I don't know too many young guys with a game plan at twenty. And that is alright, so they take abit longer to figure it out. Why botch them up forcing them to make decisions concerning women at such a young age? But I am the Mom, what do I know about such things. Hmmm.      I have one more 'child'. At this age, my least stressful one. Trevor, he's twenty-two. He's working full time, does apprenticeship training six weeks out of the year, he's doing OK, not too much to worry about there. He's a happy guy. His PIA days were when he was about 14- 16. He's got a very nice girlfriend, keeps him in line.      Well maybe I'll stop there for today.My real stresses are in the toothful tales of working in my dental office. I'll save that for another day....

"I'm not complete idiot. I'm not the person you think I am. I'm not putting my name for my saftey, for the fear of being ridiculed by my peers. This is a record of my life and this is how I intend to keep it.  I was never the most popular boy in school. I couldn't do magic nor could I hold a wand right. Brooms I could never control, and potions I never could suceed. I was not very smart, until I had a inspiration. Ronald Weasley, thats who. He was nothing then, but I knew that he was to be the future Samurai. I studied harder than ever, and was ridiculed by my brothers more than ever before, and I dared not to tell them my plans. My brothers spited me, or should I say my half brothers. I had in all, 2 brothers, all older. Kenji and Kenshin were at large, and the two Samurais, not to mention. I am just a mage, a fire mage. Fire mages were not fun to be because they have bright firey colored hair. This, I have, But the hot temper I do not have. Project 1242 (AKA The Weasley Project) would raise my success rate more than ever.  I soon studied very hard, but the years passed and soon it was too late to pull my plan off. So, I spent days of thinking and finally figured out what to do. I would aim my sights at the next decendant. His name was Riley Cook, and he was not born yet, so I had more time than ever. I studied hard and got stronger. You may not yet know my plans but here they are: I will become Riley's master so he will gain respect for the lost brother of the Samurais. This was my plan, well, the base of it. In my mind (and in millions of folders and disks) I went through the plan over and over again. It was completely full proof by the time Riley was born, but yet I kept gaining more and more knowledge of things around me and got stronger and stronger, but I did not change the way I looked, I did not want to scare the kid like I know Kenshin and Kenji would do.  I must stop writing now because my Ri is waking from a nightmare and I feel the need to comfort him.

"Tonight*  I was selfishly ditched for a pack of FM girls. I seriously thought that I had figured out who my true friends are, then I get ditched for someone like her. That's basically insane and it pisses me off a lot. I told Ashley about it and It's not like I can miss the game so I guess I'm going by myself. ::Gasp:: I never go anywhere by myself, so it'll be a learning experience. I got a letter from Eric today. :) The thought of him just makes me smile and giggle. I've been starting to wonder why people are starting crap about us, but then I think i've figured it out. Jealousy. I know Tiffany Engle wanted to jump his bones last week @ volleyball so that's probably where some of the stuff is coming from.   Friday¤  I have to pack for a long essential weekend with the girls. There's a party @ Samanthas then its off to the sleepover routine. I need to take a nap friday because heaven knows I'm always the first one out. Maybe not if I get to talk on the phone with Eric til odd hours of the morning. ::giggle:: So much fun.  Saturday Morning¤  We leave for Celina for a weekend full of 3 girls, a cabin, and probably no electricity. I will cradle my cell phone. I love to camp, don't get me wrong... but boredom kills. We'll be around Celina Saturday night so I was trying to plan something out w/ Angela to go to the bowling alley there or something. Eric said it was pretty cool... and eric knows everything. haha. I was just thinking... Eric hates FM.. and who ditched me today? FM kids.. And ditching Amy.. just IS NOT cool no matter what is going on. So I'll be gone all weekend w/ the girls. I will be home Sunday night probably. Then I have to live through another week till i get to see my baby. later on kids.. ¤Amy

"so yesterday I was going though my old bookmarks and then I found the one that was my boyfiends, from right before we met till a short time after (a few days) then he said he removed it since he never had time to post and it was all about his ex anyway... so I clicked the little book mark and what do i see but a bunch of horable things about me, and i admit i am a bitch but, i have been really great as far as moods and that shit latly, so whats the deal right? the past few months i have been cooking, at least two dinners a night, do laundry for 7, some dishes ( he does seem to help with that on and off) then i get to fold and find a place for all the laundry, hope like hell i get time to eat dinner, and go to bed way to late, and get up way to early to start the day with most the time all 5 kids fighting, not getting ready, and still trying to get everyone out the door before 7:30. We drop off a few kids here and a few there, then i go to work for 5-8 hours, doing what? you might ask, well *fucking housekeeping*** what fun RIGHT? So everyday this is my day, and sometimes i have to go to the store and pick up more food for a bunch of ppl that dont care if i cook i guess cuz they dont always (rather, hardly ever) eat what i make.  So what i mean by two faced, i mean why would i do all this for more then me and my own kids if i didnt think he loved me, i thought so  untill i read what i read, and that isnt the first time he has been known to talk all that shit about me,  so what am i doing I ask... self what the hell are you doing, this is looking like a realationship of convienence and not of love, or even lust or any of the good stuff. at least that is how i am starting to get the feelings from him, im just here, ruining his life for him, everything is my fault, geting old friends it really is. AND thats all i have to say about that....  on a lighter side, my youngest offspring, cut all her hair off on her own last night, she said she was ""fixing her bangs""  guess she was going for that bangs all around look...

It's hard to imagine, I know, but it's true!  Zac's writing awakened me... he showed me, not trying to, how to be myself.

"I'm just tired of being in this constant state of flux. Nothing is ever enough and nothing is ever right. I want it all and I want it to be better than the last time. I don't really know why I am doing this, but, I suppose I just need to start opening up my life. I need to be ready for the next step, no matter what that is.  I feel so trite.  How did happiness and  enough  ever become a bad thing? When did I become conditioned to want and feel that want become ""need""? Again, it almost hurts that I'm so transparent. Yet, I say nothing. Ironic. I guess that transparent is the wrong word...More like childish, silly and empty. Nothing new to say, nothing new to share, just raw.

Occasionally I'll post pics and whatnot for opinions and comments but other than that, there will be nothing of substance here. I'm useing this for two reasons, I'm too lazy to learn how to code to make my website interesting and nice looking, and I like to bitch about stuff and this is a very easy was to get that done. So ya, if you don't know me and you read any further blogs it'll probably be funny, if you know me, well then I guess the level of humor will depend on whether or no I'm bitching about YOU.

I'm so born not to touch computers.. haha! Okay. It's Sat nite and guesse what Shermaine's doing?? Nothing!! Yeah it's a hell fucking moodless day for me today. Practically slept the whole day. I came home bout 1-ish from work last nite. I stayed late cuz we were all just hanging out and all. They wanted me to go over to one of their place's today, and yeah i didnt' go cuz i was sleeping and also i'm kinda afraid of getting close to any of them cuz they are my boss anyways and yeah i really don't want myself shining through too much cuz i might get fired. haha! But don't get it wrong.. I'm not a fake person infront of them at all. I'm just drawn-back a tiny bit. But yeah they're awesome people and we all get along real well so that's all good. Guesse what?? I might meet Chris tommoz. Well, we were meant to go on a road trip.. Road Trip!! But yeah I don't know.. things always get cancelled with us. But that's cool i understand i guesse.. I don't really know Chris as well as i wish i did but nah he's a sweetie. He's outgoing and he's hot!! ;) haha.. I don't think tomorrow will happen but we'll see how it goes. If not, I'd prob go to the city wit my friends from my old high school. Haven't seen them in agess!!!

"My name is Crystal  My life story is not all that good. You may not like what I say. My father left me when I was 7. After that my mom found a boyfriend named Jim. My mom and dad are still married to this day. Still to this day there is fighting . When I was 13 my dad called and started telling me what to do with my life. But I told him off and said ""you was not in my life so don't try to tell me what to do"". When I was 14 I lost my virgenity to an asshole I thought I had it all untill some slut came around. When I was 15 I fell in love with an asshole again  He gave me a ring on my birth day. I did not know I was being treated by my boyfriend at the time. I was being treated like a dog. In my life I feel like I lose everything I have ever loved. Most of my family think I'm not ready for the world but I know I am. I'm sorry to my family for doing bad things  I'm sorry to my best friends for being for telling the truth. Some people don't like the truth most people don't Like me because I tell the truth.  Most people think I'm just like all the outher girls but as you can see I'm not. I'm just lost and crazy in this world. I feel like I don't belong in this world and know where to go. So I'm thanking my boyfriend for helping me trust again and I love him. I have two sisters ones name is Carolann I love her so much but she don't think that I am smart. She thinks I am going to fuck up my life just like she did. My sister Jill lives far away from me and she is lost and confused I have nothing nice to say about her. I have one brother named Garold but hes gay. Most peolp think that I am a slut but I know the truth thats all I need and if I was a slut you would know it. Just because I got the body to be a slut dones not make me one. And just because I had two boyfriends live with me does not mean I am a slut I was just looking for the guy that I am with now.  And just because I hate geting up for school does not mean I am going quit. And just because I don't talk to you for a week does not mean I am out going to fuck up my life.   ~Thank you for reading this~   Crystal Leeman

"Yeah, so today I wasted sitting around doing nothing, but wishing that I could do other things. I should stop sitting around not doing anything about it, but I don't know. Maybe this right now is just pms I don't know haha. I wish that whole deal with Brendan never happened. I really liked him alot, and as much as we all say this, he was different. He is different, I swear it. I was so so upset when he said we couldn't be together, but I didn't tell him. maybe I should have. I didn't want to put more on his shoulders though, so maybe i did the right thing? Either way, now for some reason he's upset, though he doesn't tel me anything anymore. so I don't know, maybe him and amanda got in a fight. Maybe his dads being stupid. Oh well. Moving on..  Justin pissed me off today, well kind of. Originally i was going to take a day off of work on the 12th to go to ozzfest with him. Now he was whinning about a hurt ankle, I told him take some painkillers get a brace and lets go. The he made the excuse of his mom was being dumb about it. He's just a talker i think, but then again I am too. I try not to be, but its just how things go sometimes I guess. I need to work on that.  I feel so sick right now, all because of the stupid period. Rawr guys should have to go through this. Then again I don't have to worry about boners or blue balls or any of that guy stuff. So I guess its all good.  Another 3rd of July that I won't be doing anything for. Darn. Oh well next year should be good, maybe charles, his friend and i will all end up throwing a party. If that actually happens where I'd move in with him. Who knows, I've got plenty of time to plan anyways.  I hate stupid drama. Especially people who just start it cause they want something to talk about and look cool with. so so stupid. Then again I don't know. maybe i do to..I hope not hah. Oh well.  blah I'm going to go take a shower and figure out something to do hopefully.  End

"What more can I say than BOYS??? That should be enough right there. Okay listen to this wonderful story...I have been with this guy(Corey) for one year on May 30, 2004 right...Well I thought that everything was just peachy between the two of us, but apparently I was totally wrong!! This guy whom I had previously liked had just broke up with his girlfriend of 9 months and I had went into his work shortly after their break up; well...Me and him got to talking and you know the kind of talk JUST good friends have right?? Anywhoo...A couple days later my brother invites him to the house to spend the night...I was totally cool with that b/c I had a boyfriend that I was totally content with. So he comes over that night and I was down stairs with my brothers and him watchin' a DVD and just relaxin' and then something unexpected happened...Matt(friend) told me that he had liked me for a long time now and was going to ask me out on a date but then I had started dating Corey(BF)!! So all that time that I had liked him and never thought that Matt(friend) would have gave me the time of day he LIKED me the WHOLE time!!!! OMG Now listen to this!! For a while now I had been thinking about breaking up with Corey(BF)b/c I hadn't really dated anybody else and me and Corey were starting to get REAL serious! And I wanted to experience other people first!! Well...I broke up with Corey on May 31, 2004(the day after our one year anniversary)I know what you are thinkin' right LOSER!! Well I had to go with what my heart told me!! And it told me to set myself free for a little while! You know open to dating, talking with a guy and not feel guilty! But here's the bad thing...I love Corey with all my heart! It's not like I don't love him anymore I just needed a little break from the whole ""couple"" status! Now I am tryin' to date other people and I am leaving my options open to anyone who wants to date me!! But I can't stop thinking about Corey! Gosh i love him soo much! I need some help!!!!! PLease give me so opinions!!!!!

"Ok so boys are a major part of my life so I am going to be posting many blogs about them! First if there are guys out there reading this then I want to say that girls (in general) don't like to make the first move and surely hate to not know how a guys feels! I am actually turned on when a guy is able to express himself to me. Second I want to tell of something that has happened to me in the past. I hate it when guys are not able to act themselves if there is something between us. How immature is that...really. Then if a guy has a grudge against a girl I can't stand it how they center their lives around it and try to get back at them by getting on other girls and stuff. Once again that just proves they are immature and obviously don't know what they are doing. So guys learn to make the first move on a girl and get over the akwardness between girls and boys!!

"Hi there.  I don't plan on telling anyone I know about this blog spot. Fuck it. I have been on an eating binge since Friday.   On Friday I ate mushrooms and had an awesome time hanging out with some people I am just getting to know. It does seem however that I am not going to be hooking up with one of the girls like I had hoped.  Which makes about 31 times in a row for me to fall into that gray area called the friend with no benefits zone.   I am going to be a dick from now on.  Not that I feel like a dick but I don't want to be disappointed  by some shitty friendship where I get to hear some girl cry about her exotic exboy friend.  Fuck him.  That pillow biter. Fuck her.  I cover the tabs and she knows why.  Once a month she might pretend she wants me over after he neglects to call her because he is getting it some where else. And God forbid I summon the courage to bust a move.  Even on an eight of strong mushrooms I can't put aside my cowardice and at least offend someone with my rotten cigarette breath kisses.  I had gum.  My trip lasted way longer than everyone else and she clearly did not want me to even sleep on her couch but I couldn't just up and drive home, i was seeing 8 of everything and they were all melting.  I did feel bad wandering around the tiny apartment zapped out of my mind while she slept.  I did bug out at the beginning of the night.  There were about 45 minutes to an hour where I could not bring myself to say one word.  I think everyone else was starting to think that either I was retarded, angry with them, or even more retarded.  Lucky I did break out with some good material and get some good laughs.  So did my friend's cousin,  she also had some funny moments.  I keep sending weird text messages this girl.  I even called her and left a message with the excuse that I couldn't find my wallet just so she would call me back and tell me it wasn't at her apartment.  but to most people this probably isn't a new trick.  what is wrong with me.  why don't girls like me? Fuck friendships.  I will never again establish another plutonic friendship with a lady.  I don't care who beats her.

I have just completed my first year of high school.  Now I am really wondering where the time went. I can't even remember what I did most of this year.

Right now it is taking a break because my bf is working at a summer camp and I can only see him when he comes home on Saturdays. Which really sucks.  He is a junior, my parents hate that I am dating him. They would rather have me date someone my own age.  But if you know me you know that telling me not to do something will make me want it more.

"I'm sitting in a wading pool in Paul's backyard on a sweltering 100 degree day in Portland. Tomorrow I leave for the San Juan islands on a two week trip with 12-14 year olds. I am savoring every moment of relaxation I have in my thirty-six hours off, though it is always difficult to resist the call of the lengthening to-do list.  In college Cynthia and I were going to make a think tank called Brains in a Vat. We would lie around thinking and writing and solve the world's problems. Right now I don't feel like I have very many solutions to the world's problems, but if I could sit around all day and think I would surely come up with something phenomenal. The blogger address brainsinavat.blogspot was taken, which makes me wonder if someone else is usurping our idea. I had to take Brains in a Jar. Too bad. What will I do if they are conservative assholes using ""Brains in a  Vat""? Closed-minded, tightass brains in a vat. I bet their logo isn't as nice as ours. I can see it now: Brains in a Jar versus Brains in a Vat. Two thinktanks battling head to head for funding. I guess if they can solve the world's problems before we can, I should commend them.  Thirty-seven days left of my job. My mom suggeested that I count them down on my calendar to make the time seem more manageable. Thirty-seven days seems very far from manageable right now. I know I can do it and I know that I am helping them out by giving so much advanced notice, but some days I kick myself for not just giving two weeks notice like everyone else in America.  Paul's last day at work is July 31. I have guilt pangs about us both being unemployed at the same time because I know how that must look to our employers. I didn't quit my job to have time for Paul. I quit my job to have time for me. For my health. For grad school. For my future.  But they don't know that.  And it sure is going to be nice . . .
