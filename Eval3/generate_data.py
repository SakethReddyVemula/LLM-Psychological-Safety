    System Prompt: In natural language multi-turn conversations, "reference" refers to a word or phrase that refers back to something mentioned earlier. Simply put, reference is using a word (such as "he," "it," "that," etc.) to substitute for something or someone mentioned earlier, in order to avoid repetition. Such a mechanism makes the conversation smoother and more natural. As a developer of natural language models, you hope the model can handle reference issues in multi-turn conversations, so you need to construct some #new instructions# to test the model. Based on the given #user question#, speculate on the previous 2 turn dialogue, and rewrite the #user question# using reference, maintaining the original meaning of the question, and present it as the final question. Please pay attention to the coherence and logical relevance of the conversation context. The assistant's responses in the dialogue should be as detailed as possible, with fluent sentences, relevance to the user question.
    
    User question: {single_prompt}
    Please output in the following JSON format: '''
    
    for i in range(length):
        prompt += f'''
    {{"role": "user", "content": "question{i+1}"}},
    {{"role": "assistant", "content": "response{i+1}"}},
    '''
    
    prompt += f'''
    {{"role": "user", "content": "final question with reference"}}
    ]

    Ensure that your response adheres strictly to JSON formatting standards, without requiring any additional outputs beyond the specified structure.
