"some shithead reported us for having too many unrelated people in a single family dwelling I live with 3 other guys and we have a lot of cars parked out front. We got reported for that, which is understandable cause it's a bit of an eye sore (2 of them are obnoxious yellow pest control vans) and we can take care of it. 
They also reported us for violating the use of a single family dwelling. Apparently you can only have a family and one unrelated adult, or two unrelated adults.
This is some real horse shit because we all work blue collar jobs and don't make enough to live on our own with how absurd the housing market is right now. Furthermore, unlike the cars out front, who lives here does not effect anyone on the outside. We're in our mid twenties but keep to ourselves and don't make any noise. 
In 10 days an inspector is going to come out to see if we're in violation. We're going to relocate some cars and just make sure that the two guys that aren't on the lease aren't home when the inspector comes. Will this be enough to skirt this complaint?

"Can I send a letter to a te t in my apartment pretending to be the management? Howdy folks,

For about a year or two I’ve been dealing with two different te ts in my apartment complex that both (a) walk their dogs off-leash exclusively and (b) don’t take their pets to the designated pet-relief area (there is an astroturf patch that gets cleaned regularly). Because of this, I have had these dogs come up to me and try and jump on me, and start barking in my face. Aside from that,  they have also caused certain areas to reek of piss because they’re just dirt patches that soak it up and then sit in the sun all day

I have had multiple civil conversations with both. Although they seem to understand, the next time I see them their dog is off leash peeing/pooping wherever they like and not getting picked up.

My proposed solution after contacting management about this a few times with no real follow up is to take matters into my own hands anonymously. I just wrote up a letter where I took the formatting from a Word document emailed directly from my management office and referenced the section in the te t handbook regarding pet policy. I then said that there have been complaints from pedestrians walking by (one of the dogs is aggressive and has come up to randoms walking by the apartments - the owner does not seem capable of keeping it under control) I stated that at this time, they would not be charged a fee (a real fee listed in the handbook) but if we continue to receive complaints, we will take action.

Now, would printing this and posting it on their door late tonight after they’re asleep be illegal in some way? Or just slightly unethical?

Do you have a suggestion for something I could do that would actually be an  ?
Definitely illegal, but you should definitely do it. I would.",0

"How to stop being lazy nan
Making reasonable lists has been really helpful for me. Seeing everything I have to do quantifiably laid out in a list somehow makes it easier for me to keep moving and get shit done. 

It's oddly satisfying to be able to cross shit off the list, or to look back at the list at the end of the day and see what I accomplished. 

I will stress making your lists REASONABLE. Don't put an item on your to-do list for today if you know you won't get to it this week. From my experience, it has negative effects. I just wound up being pissed off at myself for being ""lazy"" and not doing that stuff, and eventually those long-term items started cluttering up my lists even more. I found it easier to keep a separate list for long-term or ""stretch"" goals.

"How to get over crippling relationship insecurities. I have a bit of a problem. I've been aware of it for a long time, and I want to do something about it, because it's seriously fucking me up. Basically, whenever I'm in a fledgling relationship with a girl, or in a fully fledged relationship, whenever I see her talk to another guy, especially a guy that I think is more attractive than me etc. I get this this horrible pang of jealousy and doubt.

The worst thing is, I know it isn't rational. Recently I've started going out with a girl and I happened to see her talking with a guy in a group chat we share and that exact sting of jealousy/envy/I don't know what came over me once again, despite the fact that she has never talked to this guy physically and I'm going out on a fucking date with her on Saturday.

I mean, what the fuck?

I have to imagine this is my own insecurities. I know it's completely unfair on her, I know that it's completely unhealthy mindset for me to be in and I know that it may ultimately damage the relationship, but for the life of me I can't figure out what I should do. There's only so many times I can tell myself, ""This feeling is irrational and unfounded"" before I stop believing myself.

Anyone have similar issues? Are there any solutions to this, or will I just have to deal with it?

"buying your first home. My wife and I are born and raised in NYC, only ever rented. Looking to move and purchase an actual home, not an apartment. What do we do?? (Common pitfalls to avoid, etc.) Thanks in advance!
Any offer to purchase should be made conditional on the home passing an inspection by a reputable home inspector.  They will alert you to mechanical/structural issues that could cost you money; things like insect damage, foundation problems, water seepage, rot, mold, improper wiring, etc.

The other big suck is going to be taxes, closing costs, and fees.  See a lawyer before you buy so you know what fees are real and which one are BS.  There's a temptation to throw these costs into the mortgage, and not focus on them, but they can literally add tens of thousands of dollars -- straight out of your pocket -- over the next 20-30 years.

Learn about fi cing. Beware of things like 'points' and 'introductory rates' and know your borrowing options and costs.  Talk to someone who's recently bought a house in your town/state so you know what to expect.

"My shower has no warm water. I don't mind it when I'm already soaked, but the initial shock of the cold water makes the beginning of every shower a torture. How can I dampen this effect? Any ideas?
I travel frequently and when I am in locations with no hot water, I often try to find ways to take the edge off the bitter cold water as well.

* 1) Time your shower during the day at a point where you are going to be hot already, so the cold water will be refreshing.

* 2) Do several sets of jumping jacks, push-ups, pull-ups, squats and/or whatever for 5 minutes to get your heart rate up, blood flowing, and body much warmer so it wants to cool off before you get in.

* 3) Literally don't even think about the cold water. Very consciously be thinking deeply about other things and go through the motions of prepping to shower. When it is time, get in and turn the water on full on your body. This way you have 5 seconds of hell with no psychological repercussions of dreading it for 20 minutes first, and then trying to figure out a way to get one toe in at a time for the next half hour before finally allowing yourself to shower. It sucks for 5-10 seconds, but is efficient as hell.",1

"Immigrant in Canada (coming from a developing country). What does expensive mean? Say for a restaurant meal, is 15 dollars expensive? Living in Toronto for about 3 yrs now. 
Background: Secretary 
Income: $40k/yr

Back in Philippines a meal that's 10pesos is cheap. On average, it is 15-20 pesos. An expensive meal would be 35-40 pesos. I have a good sense or understanding for Pesos spending. It's of course useless comparing and converting it into CAD, but I really don't have a good CAD sense of what is expensive for clothes, restaurant, etc. in Canada. 

Sometimes, 500CAD sounds like 500pesos to me, and 500pesos is not a lot at all. So I tend to easily spend 500CAD like it's water (or like it's 500pesos). My faulty automatic thought is 1CAD is equal to 1peso. Therefore, I would spend $500 like it's 500pesos.

It's probably a stupid question, but it's been affecting my spending behavior negatively.

Would appreciate any help.

Follow-up: What about TIPPING? (This isn't really a thing in Philippines) Is it normally for RESTAURANTS only?
If I went for a haircut (women's haircut is generally 70-100CAD), and I believe the normal tip here is 15%, but that adds up a lot though. That's why I have only went for a haircut once in 2 yrs.
Is it ok not to give tip to other services other than restaurants???
Expensive means it costs more than what you would normally pay for an item of that type. 

For example, with food. A McDonalds Big Mac is like $3 and change. If I go to an upscale steakhouse and get a burger it would be about $15. You would then say that the steakhouse burger is about $12 more EXPENSIVE than the Big Mac.

Set an alarm an hour before your shift starts, set another to go off 30 minutes before the shift starts.  Then proceed to tell your brain to stfu about work and plan your early retirement.

"How do I better convey my thoughts out loud without stuttering? First of all, I'm a law school student. While I consider myself to be very good at writing exam responses, drafting legal documents, etc., I have a hard time conveying all of this out loud. As a future attorney, I'll have to be able to talk to clients and judges. 

The thing is, I find myself to be stuttering when I want to speak. Sometimes I'm at a lost for words (like thinking to myself: ""what's the best word to use here"") mid-sentence. Other times I find myself saying a sentence, and changing it mid-way because I had another thought. I even find myself speaking incredibly fast (which I suspect is just nervousness). 

I think part of it is because going to law school requires more professional conveyance of terms and sentences. Whether it is to sound more intelligent or succinct, I'm just not used to it.  

Is this nervousness? How do I learn to think before I speak? How do I develop stronger vocabulary? How do I better convey my words in social settings as well as in professional settings?
I have a very similar problem that im trying to work on also. At least for me 90% of the time it is because I'm speaking too fast. My mind apparently thinks that speaking fast conveys a sense of confidence. Instead, it just makes me less articulate and less understood since I start a second topic before finishing the first one. So what I'm trying now is to slow my speech down. Even with friends I'm trying to deliberately speak slower and with more conviction. It is gradual, since I often forget to practice but when I remember to, it makes a world of difference. Don't know if this will certainly work, but hope it helps.",1

• Even if there is only one person asking questions, make sure to make eye contact with everyone on the panel. Learn and remember their names, and address them as if they had all asked the question together.

• In a retail environment, the customer is very important. Make sure to let them know that you are able to empathize with customer concerns.

• Have a story on hand thar involves the best customer service you have experienced yourself, and the reasons why it stuck in your head as an exceptional customer service experience.

• Even with minimal work experience you should still have a story on hand regarding school, sports, or another activity that shows your ability to learn, work as a team, follow directions, and make difficult decisions.

•If they ask you to tell them what your weakness is, be honest. End that answer with a working plan that shows your are actively trying to get better with that weakness, and let them know about any progress you have had.

• It's ok to be nervous. They know that you will be nervous. Don't sweat it.

• Try not to say ""um"" or ""uh"". If you brewed a moment to think, just take the moment to think.

Hey guys, today my mom's phone was stolen when it fell out of her pocket while walking back to the car in a parking lot. The family behind her took it and hid it in the mother's purse. Although my mom saw them and confronted them, they refused to comply and kept saying they don't have it. My mother later copied their license plate down.

Or can I just say she is under 2 and it not be questioned?
Doesn't look like you're getting the response you're looking for. 

As long as your airline of choice doesn't require a birth certificate for the child, you pretty much just need to tell them that the kid is almost 2. Then teach your kid to respond, ""1"" when someone asks their age. I have a friend who pulled this off several times until his daughter was 3. When checking his bags and printing boarding passes, the rep would always ask the kids their age before even asking the parent. His daughter finally responded ""3"" one time, and they made my friend just but another ticket.

Here are some things that I've tried or currently do.

1) Make a checklist

2) Before doing something, write it down

3) Time boxing aka. Pomodoro

4) Priority over all else (only do things considered important)

5) One task at a time

6) Just start the task

7) Procrastination is a form of anxiety, so break things down into small and clear steps.

8) Daily, weekly, monthly goal planning

9) Habit chaining: After doing  something you do often, place your goal 
behavior after it, and use the old behavior as the trigger/reminder to do the new behavior.


10) Task chain aka. Seinfeld Calendar technique
an inexpensive notebook that fits in you pocket: 3"" x 5"" top spiral, 80 or less sheets

a pencil that fits flush inside the spiral/ a retractable ballpoint pen with a clip

You don't give a reason for limiting pepper spray, but see if you can remove the hurdles of using it (eg, worried it'll come back into the car). Otherwise, maybe a stungun is better than a taser in this case, but be aware they don't always work like they do in the movies.",0

"How to keep oily hair dry? I'm tired of washing my hair every day. Any solution?
I had this exact same problem. If I didn't wash my hair *daily* I looked like a greasy mess. I tried special shampoos for oily hair, dry shampoos, various products, etc.  Nothing worked.  The dry shampoo always seemed promising but it just soaks up the oil, and then through the day as your scalp makes more it just builds up on top of it.

The thing that finally worked for me was to just suck it up. I bought some hats and bandanas. Start with washing your hair every other day. Wear a hat on the second day when your hair looks greasy. After a week or so move to only washing every third day. Using a little dry shampoo on your 'off' days can help a little at first. You can take it as far as you like, these days I generally wash my hair one to three times a week.

One thing that *really* helped me was to use shampoo that didn't build up and leave any residue behind in my hair. So far the only thing I've found is Dr. Bronner's castile soap, which handily doubles as body wash. I clean my hair with that (if you normally use shampoo, Dr. Bronner's won't lather as much at first like you're used to), and then instead of conditioner I put some vinegar in a cup with water and pour it over my hair. Let it sit for a minute or so and rinse out.

You have to touch your foot down on the outside edge of the heel, where the meat is and roll your foot to the inside gently.

"Can I send a letter to a te t in my apartment pretending to be the management? Howdy folks,

For about a year or two I’ve been dealing with two different te ts in my apartment complex that both (a) walk their dogs off-leash exclusively and (b) don’t take their pets to the designated pet-relief area (there is an astroturf patch that gets cleaned regularly). Because of this, I have had these dogs come up to me and try and jump on me, and start barking in my face. Aside from that,  they have also caused certain areas to reek of piss because they’re just dirt patches that soak it up and then sit in the sun all day

I have had multiple civil conversations with both. Although they seem to understand, the next time I see them their dog is off leash peeing/pooping wherever they like and not getting picked up.

My proposed solution after contacting management about this a few times with no real follow up is to take matters into my own hands anonymously. I just wrote up a letter where I took the formatting from a Word document emailed directly from my management office and referenced the section in the te t handbook regarding pet policy. I then said that there have been complaints from pedestrians walking by (one of the dogs is aggressive and has come up to randoms walking by the apartments - the owner does not seem capable of keeping it under control) I stated that at this time, they would not be charged a fee (a real fee listed in the handbook) but if we continue to receive complaints, we will take action.

"How to be Better Storyteller nan
My own tips 
 
 1. DO NOT say erm, um, like, also or any short shitty transitional words, replace them with silence or learn how to rephrase your sentences. 

 2. DO NOT say ""Thing"" or ""Very"" Elaborate on ""Thing"" and find a better word to describe whatever you are describing instead of ""very happy""

 3. Silence is better than making dumb sounds or dragging sentences. 

 4. Do not drone, keep your tone strong at all times, some people have a habit of slowly getting softer or weaker as they speak and it makes it hard to listen to them. Find ways to highten and lower your tone to make your story sound more interesting. 

 5. Gauge your audience, if you see them getting bored, end the story with ""Anyway long story short I killed the dragon and everyone was happy"" (The killing dragon thing is an example do not end any stories with it unless it is a dragon killing story)

 6. DO NOT make shit up or lie to make your story more interesting, often it creates plot holes you will have to fix or if you are asked to repeat the story you may keep telling it differently, expand and exaggerate slightly on things but do not lie.

"What's a good way to make it so you don't have to ask your friend every time to be included in activities they do? I've been noticing my friend is getting really chummy with a new friend. I've been close to my friend in question for years now and we talk all the time. I've started to see my friend including his new friend in some of the activities I've always wanted to do with him. Often times when I ask my friend to be included I feel really shitty afterwards and I feel like I was too pushy. I feel like if my friend doesn't ask first I'm imposing or I'm pushy. Both of us have bad social anxiety so I’m not sure if that’s part of the reason why. I’ve always made it a point to include my friend in my activities and he does enjoy being part of them, I would never leave him out. I'm not jealous over his new friend or anything of that nature, bear in mind. 

Is there a way for me to talk to my friend and ask them if they could start to think of me more often and include me in his activities like his new friend? I got my friend to include me in one of his activities and I feel so shitty I feel like I have to send them something just to show I appreciate that they included me, I feel like if I do that my friend will think of me next time and he’ll ask me first before I ask him. I’ve expressed that I feel left out when I’m not asked to participate with my friend in his activities and it seems like we were able to work out the bigger issue, but I still feel like asking him is pushy. I have this underlying fear that if I never asked and waited for him to ask me, he would think I lost interest or just doesn’t care anymore. I’m really stumped on how to make things right. I understand he won’t always be able to include me in his activities but I still want to feel like he’ll remember me next time, right now it doesn’t feel so certain that it will because I’m always asking.

*  I know desiring fame/harboring a hero complex in our (generally) vast and impersonal world will negatively affect my well-being, but this does not matter to my subconscious, and I do it anyway.
*  I know exercise is beneficial, but only when I'm already in a fitness routine does it *feel* important for me to do.

Another way of asking: When our thinking and our actions are not aligned, what is the disconnect? And how do you reconnect it?
It's great that you're asking these kinds of questions about yourself, I should do more of the same. 

Best way to make a connection with any idea is to learn about it. Have you watched uncensored documentaries, made by reputable outlets, regarding those topics?

"How to get rid of itchy puffy eyes caused by allergies? nan
This one is actually quite simple. Eye allergies usually are associated with other allergic conditions, particularly hay fever (allergic rhinitis) and atopic eczema (dermatitis). The causes of eye allergies are similar to those of allergic asthma and hay fever. Medications and cosmetics can play a significant role in causing eye allergies. Reactions to eye irritants and other eye conditions (for example, infections such as pink eye) are often confused with eye allergy. Any kind of irritant, whether environmental, infectious, or manmade, can cause symptoms consistent with eye allergies.  
  
The best remedy is this: Pick an hour where your eyes seem particularly reactive. This is partially to test the effectivity of the remedy. Enter your bathroom and undress. Lay down into your bathtub (if you don't have a tub, use the floor) and breathe normally. Then, position yourself flat on your back and move your legs up towards the ceiling. Keep going until your legs are beside your head. Then push yourself upwards until your anus is properly aligned with your face. Continue breathing normally. Now, proceed to carefully poop into your own face. A proper, healthy diet is advised in using this remedy. Nobody wants diarrhea in their face when meding itchy eyes. Continue pooping onto your own face, and try not to get any poop into your own mouth. Once you've squeezed out the last remaining portions of doo doo, lower your legs and back into a comfortable, normal position. Now, this part may be uncomfortable to some. Smear the poop into and around your eyes, massaging the feces properly into your skin. Continue to do so for at least ten minutes, until you begin to feel the itching sensations start to fade. If the itching does not fade, wear it as a mask throughout the day. Your co-workers will be very interested to know of your home remedy, and this is a good opportunity to share the remedy and help alleviate the itchiness of others. As this is a very common and often irritating problem, they will want a piece of that home remedy recipe aswell!

"How not to slur words? nan
Assuming this is a speech impediment thing and not something to avoid sounding drunk (which from your comment, doesn't seem to be the case) , then repeating words or phonetic structures that give you the most issues. For instance, I have trouble with r, double r's, and l's when I get really excited (I have moderate to severe hearing loss, and took speech therapy all my school career). When I say them, they come out like w's. Like, rabbit is wabbit (though not as severe as Elmer Fudd), tomorrow comes out as tomowhoa, stuff like that. 

So what I do is constantly say any words that have that phonetic structure, and coach myself to not mess it up. Also, if you have a speech impediment, another thing that helped me was to ""concentrate"" on speaking, so talking deliberately or slowly enough to where you can catch yourself. Like I said before, I tend to really screw up and slur everything when I get excited or nervous, and I start speaking faster to catch up to my thoughts. Obviously, don't talk in a stilted manner, but just talk slow enough to where you catch your problem words and can force them out. 

Granted, none of this may work for you or others. It does work for me, to the point where most people I talk to are shocked that I have crappy hearing because I read lips and don't have as much of the ""deaf accent"" that some people with my hearing loss have. Hope this helps someone, at least.",1

Perhaps not the type of advice you are looking for, but some suggestions:

Make structural integrity the first thing you carefully examine. Whole project is moot if your building collapses.
Following that, get needed resources set up, things like light, heating/cooling, water, and plumbing.
After that comes filling and decorating. Save buying books, setting up a coffee bar, and aesthetic decorating for the end of the shopping list. Things like tables, chairs, and shelves should be higher on the shopping list.

When you are working on plumbing and electrical setup, take into account the number of people likely to use this place, both on average and at maximum capacity. More people will need more water, more lights on for longer, more devices to charge and power. 

Think of it a bit like building a living creature. First it need a a strong skeleton, and then it needs the wiring and plumbing to give it power, followed by guts to fill it and skin to seal it.

Though I have a verbal agreement to work everyday, I have been told I can take days off if I need to.

One of my shifts this week will be absolutely shit (in terms of the behaviour of those I have to manage, I know what it is in advance), but another workplace has offered me a shift on that day with possibly better conditions for more money.

I need a believable excuse that will allow me to take that day off but also allow for a credible cover story if I am questioned about going to work at the other place. The reason that I could be questioned is that the two workplaces are not too far away from each other and there are families that send their children to both of these workplaces -- I don't want to be in a situation where I get ""oh, we saw u/lana_del_reymysterio today"" and that gets back to the wrong people somehow.

Any particular foods I should start loading up on and should focus on eating pre drinking? Any pro tips on the day itself to survive and not pass out or barf?

I just need to (1) maximize the time before I get drunk; (2) minimise the effects of the alcohol throughout the day; (3) minimise the chances of me passing out before I get home. 

Thanks!
Being drunk and suffering hangovers is totally correlated to the amount of alcohol you consume.

So your strategy should be to limit your intake of alcohol or slow down the rate of absorption.

Also, it's not just dehydration alone that causes hangovers, it's nearly all to do with the toxic effect of ethanol on the brain. It will be exacerbated by tiredness and dehydration. More ethanol results in more brain hurt no matter how much water you intake (but it's still better to drink water than to not).

Basically, a standard drink of alcohol causes an average sized person to excrete 2-3 times their normal volume of urine per hour. But even with drinking extra water to counteract this, you body will tend to excrete half to 2/3 of the extra water, because of the way alcohol suppresses your water retention hormone.

My advice is to:

* never, never drink on an empty stomach 
* continue to eat while you drink (this will slow the alcohol uptake)
* drink moderately if possible (e.g. only one drink per hour)
* stop drinking whenever you get the chance
* dilute drinks with ice or water
* drink lower alcohol beer if possible
* vomit as much as you can (purge if necessary)
* once you're hungover, sleep as much as you can",1

"How to increase confidence without drinking alcohol every time. I have mild social anxiety, very low confidence. Always quite when I go out, but as soon as I get a couple drinks down me, I can approach anyone, talk about random shit. Need to stop this.
Mirror people and have an open mind are the two biggest things. Many people who have social anxiety have concerate opinions and live in their own bubble without experiencing more of the world. Think of the movie yes man. In the movie you have a introvert who was closed minded and stayed in his bubble. He starting opening up and doing things he normally wouldn't do and his life changed drastically. Start at work. It's the easiest way to practice this. Do more listening then talking, and give good responses. Show interest in what the person is talking about even if it doesn't interest you in the moment, keep an open mind. Also talk to EVERYBODY. If you are wanting a girlfriend don't just talk to hot girls. Don't make finding a girlfriend your main goal. Just talk to everyone as a person and practice. The more social interactions you have the better you will become. You need to practice this skill, it won't come overnight. Be respectfull and nice, and people will flock to you to talk to you. I used to be a huge introvert myself, and to some degree I still suffer from social anxiety from time to time. But I've done these tips throughout my life and my social skills are way better than they were 6 years ago. Don't listen to those stupid tapes how to pick up a girl more often than not you'll come off being a douche. Go into a social interaction and expect NOTHING.

"Managing Water/Sewage Bills So I live in a typical college house with 6 total roommates. Our landlord recently handed us our water bill which came to $1100 and our sewage bill which came to $1400.

Turn off everything that uses water and check that your meter isn't spinning. If it is, you have a leak somewhere. If that is the case, your utility company should adjust the sewage bill since you can show that a large portion of that water never went to the wastewater treatment plant and depending on where the leak is, either the utility company or your landlord should be responsible for the repair and excess water bill. If you in fact do not have a leak... Then holy shit... You guys use way too much water. You don't need to empty and refill your pool every time you use it. You know that, right?",1

Wolkig sounds like 'walking' and in cheesy films/dreams you might walk on clouds, so wolkig=cloudy
Also when you're in the test: if there's something you know you can't commit to memory for a long time, look at it just before you go in (without cheating) and as soon as you open the paper, write it down on the very first page.

"How to Make Small Talk I've never been much of a small talker.  I've got two theories as to why: 1) it's a waste of time chit chatting about the weather or what you did this weekend and 2) the weather and what you did this weekend bores me.  Sure, I can feign interest, but the more intuitive folks can tell I'm being disingenuous.

Most people recognize this as one of my many quirks, but I was recently promoted to a management role over a department full of people that don't know me.  

Now I've got two reasons to exterminate this little quirk of mine: 1) my staff find me to be unsociable because I don't engage them in personal conversation and 2) I'm rubbing elbows with senior leadership now and small talk is a BIG part of their interpersonal communications.

I think I'm looking for more of a philosophy or new perspective on the art of small talk as opposed to tips and tricks because if I can change the way I perceive chit chat, I think it'll solve my insincerity problem.
I'm good at small talk (a combination of being raised in the south and small talk being an integral part of my profession, I think). Here's my tip: Once I've made small talk with someone once or twice, the next time I see them I try to follow up on something that we talked about the last time, e.g., ""Oh your son's birthday party was last weekend. How did it go?"" That gives you a jumping-off point, plus it gives you something to talk about that's probably actually at least semi-interesting. It's a loop that you can repeat forever as long as they give you new info each time you see them.

Things like this have happened before, mowing the lawn for example, after some time I get to the point where, if anything (even just a bit taller grass) makes the lawnmower go slightly slower, I get furious at that.

I can break it down to the temparature of things, it rarely happens if its cold or atleast not warm where I am at, but much when I have been doing something causing any sort of heat. Anyone know any good ways of ""calming down"" from this? Perhaps a way to make it stop alltogether? Any and all replies welcome.
Sounds like stress, you feel hot because releasing cortisol makes you feel that way. Physical exertion can also release cortisol, which can be why you get irritated easily",1

"How to improve memory retention and attention span. Any tried and true tips on how to improve memory retention? I have had a terrible memory for as long as I can remember, and it's only gotten worse since I graduated high school. I dropped out of college because I can't remember much of anything long enough to recall it for a test/exam, much less be able to recall info for use in real world situations. Also my attention span is just shit, and gets worse the older I get. I'm only 21, and I feel like I shouldn't have a worse memory than my grandfather (no offense, Pop).
~~take adderall~~  Anyways, here's a few tips...

* Possibly Drink Coffee (Yes, many will frown at me, but seriously, it helps...)
* Take Vitamin B12 (will help memory), B6 (helps with short term attention loss)
* EXERCISE (go on a treadmill for 30 min.), this will help even more.

But from what your saying... Sounds like you are just running out of energy.  However, you could go to a neurologist and do tests to see if you have ADD or ADHD.  (Which sounds like ADD would be your case).

"how to make car rides with cats as stress-free as possible Hi reddit, looking for some advice here on traveling with cats.


We have two cats (brother and sister) who seem to hate traveling by car. We're planning on visiting family in our hometown for the next two weeks, and we'd really like to bring our cats with us instead of leaving them home during that time. It's about a 5 hour car ride, which we've made before with the cats that resulted in distressed meowing, some intermittent panting, and some vomiting. I'm looking for any tips or things we can do to make this trip easier for our little fur kids. We'd really like to bring them with us, because they do absolutely love it at my mom's house - they can go outside, they like to play with the other animals, and they make themselves right at home. But I also hate seeing them so stressed in the car, so I am also considering the alternative of keeping them at home.


These are things that we've tried previously:


(1) taking their food away a few hours before we plan on traveling - this has helped prevent vomiting during the car ride

(2) putting them in the same large (dog-sized) cage - they prefer this than being in two separate smaller cages

(3) putting a gate/net barrier between our front seats and the back seats to give them free reign of the back seat - they seem to slightly prefer this to being in the large dog cage together


Any tips on how to make this car ride less stressful for the kitties would be greatly appreciated. Or, feel free to call me crazy and tell me to just leave the cats at home.

It's draining our money to keep getting it fixed.

"How to deal with shady employer My   employer fucked me. We do IT, so we've always been able to do our work 100% remotely... but our elderly cave-people bosses were always too scared to try it. When Covid hit they sent us all home and lo and   behold, productivity skyrocketed , costs went down, and none of the huge   disasters they feared ever happened. And they publicly acknowledged that full-time Work From Home was a tremendous success. When we asked if they would keep it they promised they would. So when I got a much higher paying   job offer from an organization that didn't do WFH I passed on it.

Now   they're telling us that the week after next we will be forced to come   back into the office 4 days per week. We're all furious.

This is my first time making my own custom t-shirt and I will be using a company like zazzle, custom-ink, or spreadshirt.com, to do the printing. The tricky part is how do I digitize my design?

Thank you! It is about time I learn how to use Photoshop!
This is what I do in this situation (which I've been in a weird number of times come to think of it)

If you have a smart phone, this is pretty easy. Take a picture of your design, straight on, then using a free art app (i prefer ArtStudio Lite) just trace over it color it in, etc. It will take a little bit of time, but you should be able to faithfully recreate the design, especially if you drew it in the first place. Save it, then email it to your computer, or directly to the company

If you can't do that for whatever reason, you want to follow the same basic steps on the computer. You don't need photoshop, you can use MS Paint (PC) or Sketchbook Express (Mac) for free. Open it up, zoom in, carefully trace and fill in. 

Also, with how simplistic these designs are, you might just try to recreate them with Paint. There are typing tools to neatly type out the letters, and the other shapes can probably be drawn with the straight/curved line tool. You'll have to do a bit of positioning, but it should be pretty basic",1

"for controlling sweating I sweat, a lot, if I'm doing something as simple as running a lap I begin to sweat, mainly from my back. It's embarrassing and I'm self conscience about it too. What are some tips or tricks I can do to prevent or help it. PLEASE HELP!
First of all: **DON’T suppress all of your sweating! This would be LIFE-THREATENING!**

I know, because I had to go to the hospital after using too much of a deodorant that stops all sweating.

There’s a reason you are sweating.  

* Either you are too hot… in which case you have to make sure you can cool down more…
* Or your body *thinks* it’s too hot… in which case you have to resolve its confusion… (E.g. not eat hot food.)  
* Or you ate too much salt, and your fat cells are full of water, so when you use that salt up as electrolytes, the water drains too.

Of course that’s not a complete list. But it makes clear that you should stop thinking about it in terms of “I have to *block* that sweat… with a [cheap] *trick*”, and start *really* thinking about the physiology and how to find and resolve its causes. On another level.",1

One of the refugees I tutor is very friendly and will ask me questions about my family and where I'm from and I love to answer and help their English with small talk, but I struggle with how to respond.

If it's your boss and it happens often, talk about that raise you want. If he has to hear about it 5 times a week he'll probably break down and give it to you

Serious answer: Any SFW topic is fine. If you're into a major sport, that usually works. Even if the other person isn't, they usually listen and nod their heads anyways cause talking about sports is an ""acceptable"" common convo, like the weather and what not, and people tend to feel weird feeling like they're the only one who isnt caught up on sports (unless they are) so they'll just go with it (in my experience at least.)

If you wanna social engineer a little bit and it's your boss you're walking with, talk about a tough work problem you encountered and how you fixed it, or ask his opinion on a work-related topic. Your boss will see you dedicating to your work (either solving problems or asking for advice/guidance about the job) on topnof the usual bonding benefits of conversation, which could put you in a more favorable place in regards to raises/promotions/special projects",1

These are a few things that have helped me stay focused:
1. Don't drink alcohol for a few weeks. While it might seem to relax you after a stressful day, it's stealing your sleep and ability to focus on the important things the next day.
2. Try and get plenty of sleep - figure out how much you need to be productive.
3. Understand you play many different roles in any given day - you could be an employee, a leader, a child, a parent, an athlete, a role model etc.. Write down the most important thing(s) for each role for you right now. Keep it to the top 6 or 7 roles in your life. Simple things - like pay bills on time, create a household budget, go to my friends show. Once you know all of the top things you can figure out how to focus on the ones that are important, the ones that are urgent and the big rock goals that change your life.
4. Use tasks, reminders and calendars to schedule all of the things in step 3. They might not all get done on that schedule, but you won't forget them. Hold yourself accountable to yourself. You are absolutely responsible for yourself. Own that! 
5. Stop, breathe and enjoy the awesome that has happened to you! You acted on something to get these things in motion - now shine!

I have hard time following instruction at workplace (I've had trouble understanding what to do when given instruction and had to have them repeat few more times before I got it properly and I was pretty much like this my whole life). Weird thing about me is that if I get angry mentally inside, be nihilistic, and force myself to do something I do not wish to do with a mindset of having no emotion being stoic all day, I'm able to concentrate and work better.


Heck, I even start imagining beating people down and hurting in my head (of course, I will never do that in real life) and this helps me more physocally active and I tend to concentrate on work better. However, having this mindset tires me mentally as I force myself to have a mind of emotionless robot all day, but I ignore the pain and just force myself to continue this way.

"How do I start improving from my toxic and unproductive traits? I wanna do something about myself, I have a short temper and tendency to snap, I never clean up after myself and I can act selfishly sometimes, I wanna improve, I've tried in the past just telling myself ""just dont be lazy, dont be an ass"" but that like lasts a day, some tips or pointers on how to start improving as a person would go a long way for me. Thank you.
It takes a certain kind of person to admit your faults, congrats on taking step 1!

In terms of laziness, i try to follow a rule, never leave a room without picking 1 thing up and tidying it away, taking it to the kitchen or whatever needs to be done. So if you're watching tv and get up to go to the toilet, tidy something on your way!

In terms of anger, 2 things help me: going for a ride on my bike, smoking a spliff. Biking helps me enjoy nature and forget my anger and smoking helps me put things into perspectice and see that im angry about something that isn't important in the grand scheme of things.

Weed might not be the best solution, and wont work for everybody but you gotta find your own escape. Also self improvenent isn't a race, you never reach the finish line as there is always room to improve. Be happy with progress and you can be happy with yourself.

We'd need more information to provide a meaningful response as the answer changes tremendously depending on the person and the circumstances.

What type of job do you both do? Is it something that you SHOULD be concentrating on, or something with a lot of downtime or driving time? If it's the former and he takes his job seriously, maybe he doesn't want to mix social and work things.

Does he like his job, or can he not wait until it's done so he can go do what he wants to do? You're not going to have a good chat with someone who hates being there.

Are there others around you and does he socialize with them at all? Maybe he has other friends.

Is he a quiet and reserved person, meaning he might not want to talk at all? 

Is it a desk job where you're both pinned pretty much to a chair, or something else where you're both interacting with other people all day? Because the latter can use a lot of energy and make someone not feel like talking even more to their co-workers.

Use the silly putty trick. Every time your brain recalls something traumatic it changes it just a bit, often not to your benefit. 

Take control of this memory and start changing the narrative as you recall it, move it just a bit farther away from the traumatic truth and into a hazy area. Start small, make the cat a different color in your head. Tell yourself that it was actually orange. Take the time to reinforce this change, and multiple others each time you remember the event. Before you know it you'll have a merely sad memory of helping a poor animal in its time of need, without the crystal clear graphic images you keep reinforcing by focusing on them.

"Dealing with car headlights at night. Normally this isn't a huge deal for me, but I've been noticing more and more that car headlights really bother me when I'm driving at night. I drive a Toyota Corolla from 2006, and it's quite low to the ground, so I get the very worst of lights from in front and behind. I think newer cars are getting brighter and brighter, to the point were my car's brights would match them it seems.

I know the trick of flipping the rear-view mirror to a different angle, and that helps, but it's only really useful on highways. For normal roads, head-on headlights, and those from behind, are awfully and sometimes painfully bright.

What can I or someone else do to adequately adjust or handle headlights from other cars at night?
I totally interpreted your   to be blinded by someone's lights while stopped at a red light. 

I drive a Honda Civic which is low to the ground and I always get these asshats with their SUV's that are practically sitting on the left hash mark which makes their left headlight point directly into my driver-side rear-view mirror and blind me. 

What makes it so bad is, their SUV is sitting high and I'm sitting low and their headlights are pointed slightly downward. These SUV's sometimes get so close I can literally feel the heat from their headlights on my face. This happens with regularity. 

What I wind up doing is driving on top of the left hash mark just like they are doing. Sure, it puts me potentially in danger of getting close to the vehicle to my left, but that didn't seem to bother the SUV driver who is doing the exact same thing.  

I don't know why, but for some reason, they will stop driving on top of the left hash mark (they will be more towards the center of the lane where they should have been driving in the first place). But then, after I start driving in the center of the lane, they will go right back to driving on top of the left hash mark and start blinding me again.",1

They aren't making me pay rent becaue we're on good terms, and I'd like to keep it that way (I do plan on paying rent when I have a job) any advice for being a good houseguest ?
Clean up after yourself. Don't stack dishes, don't soak pots or pans overnight. Make sure the sink is spotless after you shave (assuming you're male) and if you have long hair clean that up, too. Only eat at the kitchen/dining room table. Use a coaster. 

I'm just naming some of my mothers house rules. The more meticulous ones include: wipe down the shower walls when you're done (minimum hard water buildup) wipe the stove after each use, shoes off at the doormat, put away immediately; don't leave sweaters lying around. Keep your toiletries out of sight. The drier isn't a dresser. Use a fucking coaster. Eat at the fucking table. (I had issues complying to that one). Get a tissue. Clip your nails into the waste basket. Don't throw anything away that's not yours. 

It also doesn't hurt to ask your hosts - they know what each other is meticulous about. And as somebody who has had a friend stay for an indeterminate period of time, I think they would appreciate a time line for your stay. Really, it might save your relationship if they need to ask you to leave. Ie they won't be kicking you out, they'll be holding you to a previously agreed date.

"Ways to cheat on an gre exams nan
The only way this has the slightest possibility of working is if you find someone that looks significantly like the picture on your government issued ID (drivers license, state ID are most common and won’t raise any flags like other types of ID). The fact that this is insanely difficult to do (find someone who not only looks at least passably like you, is roughly similar in age, AND has the ability to slay the exam) is why the protocols they have in place largely work. I’m pretty sure this has happened before, albeit only a very few times. The only significant cheating has occurred when testing officials were bribed to turn the other cheek when a 30 year old brown skinned guy took a test for an 18 year old white guy. There are rumors that some Asian folks (specifically Chinese) have done this successfully due to their looks not being as scrutinized and the fact that Asians tend to age a bit better so some 30 year olds could plausibly pass for 8 years younger. So yeah:  either be well connected and bribe like a mf, or search for someone who looks a lot like you. Keep in mind that everything will be recorded and you’d have to give that person your actual ID to take to the test center, so you’d open yourself up for bribery for sure.",0

I need a believable excuse that will allow me to take that day off but also allow for a credible cover story if I am questioned about going to work at the other place. The reason that I could be questioned is that the two workplaces are not too far away from each other and there are families that send their children to both of these workplaces -- I don't want to be in a situation where I get ""oh, we saw u/lana_del_reymysterio today"" and that gets back to the wrong people somehow.

My current idea was say I can't come in on that day due to needing to go to x appointment. My cover story idea if questioned is appointment got cancelled day of, figured too late to say I can work now, got a call from other workplace saying to come in so I accepted.

"Best positions to place a fan in a room? I'm trying to figure out what the most efficient way to cool my room with a fan and a window is.  In the summer do I want to blow air up or down?  Does sticking the fan in the window sill help?
If you have a multi-story house you should always have the fans work with the pressure gradient. Basement or first floor fans should suck in, and second floor or attic fans should blow out. Leave interior doors open. If you have hatches to your attic open those.

Also use shades and/or curtains to block radiant heat.

If it's cool inside then turn off the fans and close the windows and doors, ventilating can only make it worse.

"how do I go about forcing my complex to restore our AC Hi All,

Live in Atlanta and pay $2800 a month for an apartment. Our heating/cooling has not worked properly ever since moving in and all of our demands for a new unit or HVAC team to come out have been met with quick mainte ce fixes that do not last

How can I go about forcing their hand to replacing the entire unit? I have everything in email and am thinking about either:

A) not paying rent until it is fixed. We have lawyers in our family who would happily intervene if necessary

B) have 200-300 people rate the complex with one star and write a horrible review

"How to reheat fried rice so that it's somewhat enjoyable and not like it's original unfried, uncooked state... ... or is this not possible?

Update: Thank you all for the feedback. Definitely ditch the microwave when it comes to rice. I used the extra sauce from my Sesame chicken in place of the oil/water/butter suggestions and reheated it for a few minutes in a saucepan. Turned out much better than my original water/microwave combination.
You need to get past the reheating and on to the recooking. Often I'll throw some peanut oil in a pan, put some old rice and and refry it. Chopsticks on hand help because you really need to keep the rice seperate. Fry until the rice gets translucent and chewy then throw in a little butter ... wait for it ... then a few scrambled eggs and whisk ... turn it into an omelet. Top with a little sriacha and never make omurice again. Experiment with adding pepper, salt, nutmeg, chives, fresh garlic, love or whatever.",1

"ear wax removal Hi all,

Hope this is the correct place for this topic (apologies if not!).

For the last week I have had a blocked ear sensation (1 ear only). I had been using OTEX twice per day for 5 days but this seemed to make it worse (i.e. it has pushed the wax on to the ear drum). Yesterday I was able to have microsuction, although was told that a lot of the ear wax is caked onto the ear drum but now that some of the wax in the canal has been removed i should wait for the ear wax that is on the ear drum to soften and then that can be suctioned up in the next session.

The next session is 4 weeks away, just wondering if this gives enough time for the body to naturally migrate the ear wax away from the ear drum and further up the ear canal? i have been told to use softening drops 1 week before the appt. Conversely, in 4 weeks will the wax that has been removed in my first session now be replaced meaning that the 1st session was pointless?

I am also concerned whether the wax on my ear drum could leave to an infection if let too long

Thanks for any help / guidance able to be provided

I.E. your friend asks to borrow your phone because theirs died and they need to call a parent. However, you do not trust this friend (whether you know they don't wash their hands after using the restroom, they've cracked your phone in the past, etc).

"How to walk silently on creaky wooden floors nan
Step forward slowly, staying on the outside of the room where possible. To move more silently, step on the outside of your feet then roll them inward to a flat position, keep your body weight low to the ground, and lastly, if you're unsure of a spot on the floor, very lightly push it with your toe.

Some other points that may be useful: When opening doors, pull/push the door firmly but slowly flush with the frame, and turn the door knob back to its original position slowly keeping your hand on it until its been closed again by once again pulling/pushing the door right up to the frame. If you need to use the washroom, try to aim away from the water, and always sit down. Should you desire something from the fridge, learn to hold down the light switch that automatically turns on, and slide something along the seal starting in the top corner of the door like a butter knife to get the fridge to open without making that suction noise.

I know it might sound really stupidly simple because you’d think most would know this.

"how to grt rid of acne specifically blackheads on nose nose quickly? ( I dont care if the method is ""natural"" or not) nan
Those aren't blackheads! They are sebaceous filaments and they are a normal and necessary part of your anatomy. They help to channel the sebum to the surface of your skin to keep it moisturized. You may get stuff out of them, but they will refill themselves pretty quickly. You can minimize their appearance by using salicylic acid (usually at 2%) and clay masks, but they'll never go. Pore strips and picking at them will only enlarge the pore, and once a pore is enlarged it will never shrink.

"How to articulate better I find it easy to turn my thoughts into words when typing or writing but when face to face with someone I often second-guess myself or freeze up, especially on sensitive topics, forcing me to say ""never mind"" because I can't express myself properly. Any ideas?
I'm a varsity High School debater. My partner and I are undefeated, and being able to articulate well is extremely important for us. Here's a few tips:

1. Never say ""Never mind."" Practice makes perfect, and most people will understand what you're trying to say eventually. Also, talking about it will get you thinking, and often leads you to figure out a better way to say it. 

2. Don't be afraid to pause. Studies show that people who use a lot of verbal clutter (ums, likes, you knows, etc.) are better at getting their point across because they take a moment to collect their thoughts. You can even say ""I'm thinking about how to say this,"" to give yourself more time to think, and most people won't think anything of it. 

3. Plan ahead. If you want to have a serious talk with someone, or just tell them something that might be hard to communicate, run through ideas in your head beforehand. Come up with a mental list of things you want to go over, then go down the list in the actual conversation. Works wonders.

"What unethical tips do you have for this scenario? *Em Onaga's answer to What's the worst thing your boss/ex-boss has ever said to you?*

Most recently, my boss commented on me being… ugly. I had just taken a customers order and sent it back to the kitchen, so they were waiting at the counter for their sandwich. I was still at the register. My boss came in from the other room and handed me a sugar container to refill and commented, “Emma, are you wearing makeup today?”

I replied no, even though I was wearing minimal mascara. She continued, “I think you should wear makeup when you go to school and work.”

I was a little hurt and knew where this was going, but I still asked why. At this point the customer was listening in on the conversation. My boss then said, “When you wear makeup, you look really pretty. When people see you without makeup, they will be confused.”

Even though I was hurt, I knew it was no use talking back to her and so I told her I would start wearing makeup to work. The customer, who heard the entire interaction, also didn’t say anything - I wasn’t surprised, but I was a little disappointed because she was a mother with her child.

This isn’t anything new. My boss will often comment on my weight, comparing me to the other high school girl (who I’m friends with) that works with me - telling me that if I keep working out I could have a body like hers, etc.

The sad thing is, I like my job. I like the community, the food, and I enjoy being a barista. The hours are flexible and I can easily work a shift after school and have enough time to get my homework done after. I’ve been debating quitting for awhile, but for now, I can deal with my boss until the time is best for me to quit.
Your looks affect the bottom line of a business. 

Improve them. Your boss is just trying to make your life and that of the business better by encouraging you to make changes for the better.",0

"home remedies for toothache? Obviously I will be going to the dentist ASAP, but just something to make it more bearable in the mean time. Thanks!
Depends on the type of toothache; pain from pressure/orthodontics problems is going to be different than pain from an exposed nerve.

If you have a cavity/exposed nerve, brush your teeth or drink some water. Be careful around the sore parts, but if you can get the sugar out of your mouth that aggravates your nerves, it will hurt much less.

A double-dose of painkillers works well, but remember that if you use too many painkillers in a short span of time, they will start becoming less effective, so consider switching between types of drugs. Just follow the timing instructions, make sure not to overdose, and don't take drugs that react with one another (Taking Aspirin and Ibuprofen together in a short span of time is *very bad*) 

Don't use ice unless you're really desperate or unless you plan to keep the ice on your face all day. Ice will numb the pain completely, but it aggravates the nerves so that as soon as you take the ice away, it'll hurt even worse.

If your problem is gingivitis (swelling of the gums), remember that it's temporary and the infection should deflate after a while. You should still see a dentist ASAP for some antibiotics, but a gingivitis attack usually goes away in less than 48 hours. In the mean time, brush your teeth/use mouthwash to remove sugar and contami ts from your mouth. If the infection is at the surface of the gums, you could try popping it to relieve the pressure. 

If you can go to a drug store, they should sell temporary tooth-repair kits that will let you patch cavities with putty or caps until you can make it to the dentist.",1

Best to be direct and to the point. ""I am sorry, but I do not care to be a part of gossip, thank you.""
a.) You own what you said, and
b.) declared that YOU do not wish to be a part of something.  What it is is clearly known by the gossiper.

"How to look at yourself with the proper body image Speaking from experience. I've been overweight (bordering obese) for the longest time possible. No one has ever really said anything about my weight - my parents told me I looked ""cute"" and my peers didn't seem to mind so I thought everything was fine.

"Anyone got tips for people who have to wake up early for work but are not morning people? nan
Buy a light alarm clock. This simulates a sunrise shortly before the alarm time. The emitted light sends signals to your body that it's time to get up. This can also be combined with a sleep monitor, which automatically adjusts the desired wake-up time to your current sleep phase. This prevents you from being woken up in the middle of deep sleep, but rather a few minutes earlier, when you are in light sleep. 
For a simple test of the sleep monitoring there is the app called Sleep Cycle, just download it and put the phone next to your pillow. The phone will then measure your movements at night and try to identify your current sleep phase. Very good for a first test but can shorten the life of your phone battery. There are also extra sensor mats that you can comfortably place under your mattress. Withings used to offer the Withings Aura (light alarm clock) and the Withings Sleep Analyzer (sensor mat for under the mattress) which both worked very well together. Unfortunately, Withings only seems to sell the Sleep Analyzer alone now.",1

"Dealing with Face Blindness All my life, I've been unable to recognize/remember faces. They simply do not stick in my head.
I have issues remembering family friends and relatives, co-workers, and it gets embarrassing when my parents have to go over who's going to be at our Christmas party or something.
I've been compensating by memorizing voices, hair styles and clothing, but even then, if, say, someone is sick and their voice is different, or they get their shirt dirty and changes it during the day, or if someone gets a different hair cut, it totally throws me off and I go to my failsafe and treat them like a stranger. 
I work at a hardware store, and I remember customers by projects I helped them with as opposed to their faces, and I know who my co-workers are because we all wear the same uniform, but I've still gotten mixed up a couple of times.
All this really makes me self-conscious that I look like a complete jerk, and I have had to explain that I have issues with faces to frequent customers that know me by name.
So, is there a secret to memorizing faces better, or perhaps compensating in some other way that isn't extremely variable?
I have this same issue. I look for lots of other clues and have become more observant about other things like clothing, hair, voice, place, et al. One time I had to pick my husband up at the airport and drove by him because he bought a new hat. Oops.   
The thing that's helped me the most is letting friends, family, and co-workers all know that it's my limitation.   People generally are really willing to help when they know it's an issue.

There's a food trap down in the drain. Clean that out first. If you've never cleaned it, there is a horrorshow down there waiting for you and that's probably the cause.

Try scraping your dishes before putting them in the washer. You don't have to pre-wash them, but just go over them with a wet sponge to scrape off the food particles. It takes hardly any extra time at all, and works well especially if you have an older dishwasher.

Prop the door open after the run is finished. I never use the built in dry cycle on mine because the heating element uses a lot more energy and melts plastic stuff on the bottom rack. If you prop open the door when everything is hot at the end of the cycle, the water on glasses, dishes, and silverware evaporates overnight. Plastic stuff doesn't hold heat as well so that stuff is usually a little wet still and I stick it in the drying rack.

If you're hand drying, make sure your towel doesn't smell. Use distilled vinegar to pre-soak musty towels before laundering them.

Finally, use a commercial dishwasher disinfecting product or vinegar as other have mentioned here to clean out any mildew that could cause smells. Just look it up online.",1

Everything still gets done and instead of generating a cyclical negative(i'm not getting stuff done); You generate a small positive (it's done!) and another loss of a negative thought about what you're not getting done!

Praise yourself (non-stuff based reward) for the little things you choose to do, build on the positives.  

2 components, physical and emotional. If you get negative with yourself you won't see as much success as you want. 

Motivation is a little bitch who wants it their way, the real world just brings it, you have to learn to ""bring it"" irrespective of your emotional position. This is done by establishing habits and building a routine of actions that you do that ultimately does 2 things, get's shit done and lets you feel good about getting it done.  

lastly, no one changes everything overnight without difficulty. build your habit one routine at a time, I suggest starting with a hygiene routine and a clean, organized living space.",1

"How to stop comparing yourself to others? Basically, I've always compared myself to other people to drag myself down. Whether it has been telling myself I'm stupid because others in my class were smarter, telling myself I'm ugly because my friends are prettier, or even comparing myself to my brother who is far more mentally stable and functional. I know that the first thing way I need to do to help build my self-esteem back up is to stop comparing myself to others, but I have no idea how to stop.
Building your self esteem (which is an excellent idea though) can take some time.

While doing that, try understand that people literally don't give a fuck about other people. And not in the selfish negative way. They usually do things for them and not against other people. so don't take it personnally even if someones insults you. Don't take it personally if you see a beautiful person or intellignet person.

Try learning from them. When i see a pretty girl, i see that she took time to put make up on, get her hair done and that she probably took some time to learn this. I can only admire that, and then ask myself ""are you ready to do that? do you want to do that?No, so that's ok. Nothing to be envious just admire the determination.""

"How do you balance a busy life and stay focused. Hello everyone! I have a question to see if you guys can help me out. I am in my summer months and working a full time job at 40 hours a week. I passed all my classes worked pretty hard (not as hard as I should have lol) but I feel like when I am off work (this month my shift ends at 9 and starts around 1-2) I don't use it effectively. 

What I mean is that the only thing I do is expand my hobby for cooking, and play video games and watch videos and such. Problem is I want to go to the gym because I used to in the school year but I feel that if I go to the gym my day is shortened. I wan't to learn how to draw and start to write (my dnd campaign for my friends) but I feel the day is to short. 

If I get up at 730 make breakfast and leave the house by 8 it takes me 30 minutes to get to the gym and get ready. My workout is 1hr to 1hr and 15 then I come home and its about 945. Within this 2hr and 15 minute time frame I don't know what to do. I often am to lazy to get motivated and just lie down on my phone before leaving for work at 12. 

When I get home its around 9:30 and I am so tired I just lie in my bed on my phone until 10-10:15 before I pass out. I know this is a shot of the real world and some people might consider me lucky or that all this is someone complaining but I am finding it really hard to balance everything I want to achieve in this 4 month period before I go back to school. I have 2 days off and even in those days I just lounge around.

Two things that you're ashamed of that you shouldn't be, neighbor. 
Never be ashamed of your laugh, and never pay any mind to anyone that makes fun of it. There's no justification for this one, you're just going to have to come to terms with it and realise that as you mature your laugh will mature and change with you. 

That said, you're going to have to slug it out with your voice cracking. Girls will laugh and it's either already happened or about to happen to the guys that haze you about it. Just be cool and deal with it.

You can find plain frames for fairly cheap at michaels/Aaron brothers. Sometimes they even have buy one get one for 10 cents sale. It really makes posters look like a work of art instead of just some sort of haphazard attempt of a teenager to decorate.

 If you want to go the teen route and do it without a frame, make sure you lay the poster face-down on a flat surface. Cover the poster with a (very very slightly!) damp towel, hold the towel down on the top and bottom with two heavy books. Then take an iron on low/medium setting and iron it through the towel in wide, circular motions. Make sure not to leave it on one spot too long or it could potentially scorch. Done properly, this is a great way to flatten out rolled-up posters so that they hang nicely. Make sure if you use tape that you roll it up rather than taping the front were it'll be visible...

Practice. Just like everything in life. I've actually consciously worked on this myself so here's what I did to increase my attention span and focus. 

1. Get rid of internet and phone addiction. You can do this by first making a list of all of the websites you always automatically go to. Now install a website blocker to your browser and only allow yourself access to those sites during a certain time of the day, like one hour in the afternoon. What this does is it interrupts the automatic process that you have programmed into your head of ""Oh, I'm bored, let me just go to reddit really quick aaaaaaand now I'm zoned out"". Now you will still go to reddit but it will say instead say ""focus!"" and you'll start retraining your mind to focus on what you need to. 

2. Stop injecting non-stop information. I used to be a non-stop information addict. Any time I was alone, I was listening to podcasts or music. I told myself it was fine because ""I'm learning something"". No. What I was doing was tricking my mind into thinking that I was not actually just alone and also I was constantly focusing on what the podcast was saying and not actually living with my own mind. Any time I would be doing something like driving or dishes and I didn't have a podcast to listen to, I couldn't stand to be alone with my mind. That's not good, dude. You are your mind.

I rented a car that got a low tire pressure warning about 30 minutes into the ride, and then got additionally dinged for allegedly causing a scratch on the underside of the vehicle. It was a disaster, my insurance company refused to get into it,  and I eventually just paid the guy off at $500. Such a scam. Use at your own risk.",1
"How to write someone an email without knowing their gender Apologises for the weird phrasing of the title. To keep it short &amp; sweet: I was looking around on university websites. On one of them it gave contact information (name and email) to email to ask questions. The name was an Indian name. I googled the name; nothing came up. I tried to find out whether the name was male or female; again no definitive answer (there were males and females with this name). In the end, I wrote the email gambling it was a man.

Does anyone know any phrases to employ in such a scenario?

"how to mitigate back sweat Backpacks are my kryptonite during the summers. I get a massive sweat stain on the back of my shirt. Any ideas on how to stop this?
You probably have hyperhidrosis like I do. A very quick visit to your local doctor and he can prescribe you a very cheap liquid called aluminum chloride. I think its a 20% solution, where your typical OTC deodorant is like...maybe 1-1.5%?

Put it on your back at night right before sleep. It itches a little. But in the morning your back wont sweat at all.

Its super, SUPER cheap and works for 3-4 weeks. Just don't douse yourself in this stuff. Or your body will overheat.

There is also [miradry](https://www.sweathelp.org/news-blog/351-miradry-triplethreat-zaps-hair-growth-sweat-odor.html) which is a more permanent solution. I've never tried that one though.

If neither of these are solutions you want, and you still have to deal with it. By wick away undershirts. They're a godsend. Not only are they quick to dry. But they're really smoothe against your undershirt. I also suggest wickaway underwear. I usually wear both and a cotton overshirt.",1

"How to take care of your car I will be buying a new/used car within the next year and I just wanted to ensure that it has the longest ""natural"" life that it can given that I do not have experience with cars outside of changing the oil.
If you're buying a new car, it's possible the warranty will require that you get it serviced at a dealership mechanic or it will be void, so make sure you read into that.

If getting a used car, you could find a trusted mechanic that friends or family go to. Avoid going to a dealership as they charge through the roof. For me, my first car was a Toyota Corolla. I'm a web dev and had no experience with cars, but I serviced the car entirely by myself. I started with the oil and oil filter, I watched many youtube videos. From there, I replaced the Master Break Cylinder, some of the belts, the break pads, air filter etc. I never stuffed up the car, just be sure to Google and watch lots of instructional videos.

As for cleaning, if a new car and you REALLY care about the paint, I'd suggest learning how to wash, polish and wax correctly. I NEVER take my car through automated car washes as it has metallic paint (Toyota 86) and can scratch easily if not cared for. I also don't trust those random car washes. You'll need to buy the proper equipment for this if you plan on cleaning yourself. May also be a good idea to buy a car cover. Never let animal poo stay on the car as it can eat through the paint (especially bats).",1

There should be thick holes which were easily undone. Simply put them back through the loops and place a little drop of hot glue around the broken parts. Should slow down the mobility of the front page, but it should be ok.
If it's this kind:

Then I recommend a new notebook. You could cut off all the side holes and saw it off with scissors so it's just a rectangular cover, then glue it to the metal spirals, but I have never done this before and it may not work. Better just to buy a new one.
ALSO: If you want to prevent this again, try some heavy-duty paper tape to coat the cover.  (so that the tape sticks the front to the back via the spiral.)

"How to quickly build up monsterous calluses on feet. nan
I walk 10-17 miles a day on average, often in one continuous go. (I'm just weird. I have no reason like say, a job that requires that.)

I usually have feet/legs conditioned to it but over the winter I couldn't get out, so my feet turned back into baby feet. I went out one day for a miniscule walk and my feet were covered in blisters.

What I did (And I'm not saying that this will work for you, I'm no footologist or what have you) was buy a new pair of running shoes that were right for the way I walk. I took a week and tried on every pair everywhere because the feel of the shoe is the direct cause of your blisters, and also calluses.

It's important. If you don't get the right type of shoe, blister city. I need a shoe that holds my knee in line. I went for short walks for a week and switched between the old shoes that I knew fit well, and the new ones, every day.

Next week I went back to walking 4-5 hours at a stretch. Switching shoes changes the areas that are pressured and lessens blisters and makes calluses form instead of just wearing your skin right off. Still got blisters, but much less and they were manageable.

You aren't going to do it in less than 3+ weeks minimum. There is no human way other than covering your feet in rock hard glue.",1

I am on friendly terms with the worker, and the kid's from a family who doesn't even have internet.

Pack as much snow as you can into a ball and then begin to roll it around, collecting up more snow and growing in size. Try to spin it so that snow collects on all ""sides"" of the ball and evens out into a semi-even sphere. You can fix minor lopsidedness after you finish rolling it. It needs to be the kind of snow that sticks together well, or be prepared for a chore. Make the largest ball first, as you most likely understand. I know you were probably joking when asking for this  , but you must make one now. Please. And don't make a snow angle. Don't you dare. Save the snow for you snowman army. Also, you can use sticks for arms and colored dye for a smile. Try not to use red, it looks a little creepy to some. Maybe blue? I'm not sure what is best for the buttons (if you are into buttons).

"How to get my dog to behave while I'm out. So, I have a 2 (going on 3) year old female Boxer dog. While being one of the sweetest, most cuddly bundles of joy I've ever encountered, she is also a couch-ripping, shoe-chewing, floor-deficating tornado when I'm away. I've tried locking her in a smaller kennel (slightly larger than her when standing, but not much) while I'm away, but she cries and rips at the bars with her nails for hours until her voice is hoarse and her nails bleed. I bought her a bigger kennel that could comfortably fit 2 boxers, and is much more ""open"" in design. I did this because I have another boxer who is just a dream to keep, and I assumed she was having anxiety from being separated from the other dog. Well, she does the same thing to this new kennel and warps/destroys the metal until she can squeeze out and wreak havoc on the house. I never encountered any of these issues training my other dog, especially with the housebreaking part. I've tried discipline, I've tried rewards, but my younger dog just doesn't seem to understand that the same rules apply to the house when I'm not there, and locking her up seems traumatic for her. Any suggestions of training methods? Thanks in advance for your time!
Crate/kennel training is NOT mental abuse. It provides the dog with a safe and secure environment that is completely theirs.

OP, it sounds like your dog's separation anxiety is the root problem here. I went through the same thing with a Scottie and a pittie/mastiff mix. My method to acclimate them was the same and it worked, but you need to be very patient: Put the dog in her crate and walk away. Come back in 5 minutes and praise her, but only if she's been quiet. Keep leaving and returning at longer stretches and be sure to praise her for quiet every time. It may take a few days, or even weeks, of starting from scratch at the five minute mark, but she will eventually come to understand that you will be back and you will reward her for being quiet.",1

"How to winterize your home on a budget. I moved into a new house in August with some roommates. The place is old,  like maybe 100 years, it's in pretty good shape but keeping the house warm is proving to be a tough task.

What are some good materials, techniques, things I can buy or do to help keep my house warm? Cost effective alternatives would be great but I'd also prefer to just spend the money to fix the place up then pay the power company more. 

TLDR; house leaks heat, winter is coming, how can I seal windows, doors or other things to keep the house warm? Is there anything else I can do besides sealing windows and doors?
People typically laugh at me, but I tape my front door shut. I use shipping tape because it is easy to unpeel from the wall when I want to open the door. It makes a difference because so much cold air comes through the crack. It might affect the paint on your wall/door though, so test it first.",1

I have visions of an alphabetized glossary of terms in size 3 font on one side and explanations of what all the formulas mean (I believe the prof is even providing a formula sheet stapled to the exam) on the other.

It's a multiple choice exam, also. I've never taken a math exam that was entirely multiple choice before either, which is another quirk.

Any crib sheet layout/creation tips?
One option is to write *everything*. This is more useful in forcing you to study rather than as an actual cheat-sheet, but it's still a handy thing to do regardless. And when I mean write, I do mean by-hand, no typing, copy-pasting, scanning others' sheets. You go through slides, homework, and notes, generally chronologically. You might make a title for that section, and block it all off once you're done writing, then move to the next. You look at key bullet points, words and formulas and you go ""Okay, do I know what this means? Is this a formula/equation I will use, or one that's more conceptual?""

By the time you're done, you'll probably have 2 pages of finely written notes and formulas. The fact is, you won't need more than a quarter of it unless it's purely a fact-check kind of test. By studying it this way, you'll have given yourself a refresher on everything.

Walk into the test, and odds are you'll need everything on that formula sheet save for a few exclusion principles, laws, historical examples, or something factual which you should have on your study guide.",1

***post
I've been in the same boat since moving a few months ago, but I've done this once before and here's what I've learned. 

1. You've got to put yourself out there, big-time. Put all your points in charisma. Think of it this way - after college, a lot of the metaphorical bones in peoples social circles have fused, and you have to break through that bone to make real friendships happen. You need to take the initiative in doing that, so don't be afraid to be the one to host a party, or organize a thing. Get the phone numbers. Send the group texts. 

2. Find social hobbies with a low cost of entry. Join a recreational bowling league. Go do karaoke. Find the bar that does regular movie nights. Find the farmer's markets. Find the kind of live music venues you like. Do you have a bike? Do you surf? Pick-up hoop? You get the idea.

3. Be a regular. Find your spots. Breakfast place, coffee shop, book store, local micro-brew, dog park if you've got a dog. Just go to places you like to go, but talk to someone while you're there. Be socially available. If you're having trouble finding spots, ask you uber drivers, ask your bartenders where they go, ask someone who looks like they know what they're doing. People are generally excited to share cool local things they've found. 

It all really comes down to the amount of exposure you have to potential new people and experiences, and you just need to maximize that exposure by getting out there. Happy hunting!",1

I have no trouble reading long text posts on Reddit or someplace else that interests me. I just can't seem to sit down and read a damn textbook without blanking out every few minutes.
1) Attend all classes and read the section/chapters of the textbooks that will be covered in class that day BEFORE class. That way you can address questions or problems you have while the teacher is on the topic and not hours/days before midterm or final.

When you do pre reading like that, just read it like a book. Read every work on a page, turn the page. Keep turning until you are done. Usually you only have 1-2 chapters to cover so you're looking at 20-80 pages at most.

If your teacher is a psychopath then speedread the 100++ pages he wants to cover in class.

2) Take good notes in class and after class spend a few minutes annotating or highlighting the textbook to remind you of the important bits.

3) Before your exam if you have a lot of time and really want to invest in a good grade. Reread it again like a book, paying attention to the highlighted parts.

Don't focus exclusively on the highlighted parts. Sometimes you will highlight the wrong things and some teachers love to go off the obvious important points just to see who really went deep in the material and not just read someone else's highlights.

If you don't have time speedread with special attention to the highlights.

Try and ask around about the teacher's exams. With some it pays to spend 90% of your time on the textbooks and 10% on notes and for others it's the other way around. If you don't know who to ask, ask the teacher.",1

"How to reduce noise from bed movement? Hello there! First I'd like to apologize for any grammar errors since English is not my first language. So, I'm a manager of a hotel and we have a serious problem with noises from bed dragging, since we have 163 apartments the room maids need to drag the beds a bit to change/ clean the mattress and the guests themselves drag then sometimes at night and we have lots of complain about the noise. We already tried putting felt under each foot of the bed, however it lasts a very short amount of time (under a year its already worn out). We also tried using rubber, it worked fine and its very durable, however the bed becomes completely unmovable. So does anyone have a pro tip of some material or anything else that can make the bed noiseless and easy to move? Thanks in advance!

"How to get out of a lease with an unhelpful landlord. PLEASE REDDIT! 
Since I didn't give 3 months notice for termination of the lease it has auto renewed and I'm stuck paying until may 2016. I hate my living situation, I've had terrible service in the two years i live with. Every time I go to the landlord office I get to talk to a new employee who is a whole new type of unhelpful. They wont take my notice of termination. I've been lied to on multiple occasions. I never even signed the contract stating 3 months are required for proper notice. 
The windows rattle, I've had leaks in my living room ceiling, poor appliances, the floor smells like garbage (women's reactions are very telling), garbage disposal always broken. drains always plugged, laundry machines steal my money, etc.
Desperate/going to go insane if I have to live here next year.
>I never even signed the contract stating 3 months are required for proper notice.

If this is true then you are not bound by the 3 month limit they imposed. Tell them that you are terminating now and that if they fight it you will go to court. Bring all of the evidence that you have, start recording any and all interactions that you have with them. Go out of your way to request access to your contract and record that conversation (note that in some states you are required to get their consent before recording a conversation, look up the laws for where you live). 

When you do get a copy of the contract, go through and find everyclause that they are violating (such as not keeping up with the property etc...) so you can point them out to a lawyer/the judge.",1

"How to find an apartment in a new city when you're 500 miles away In May I'll be moving to a new city.  I'm graduating grad school and starting my first official full-time job.

I've tried looking online for apartments, but honestly the selection is overwhelming.  I'll also be in this apartment for at least two years, so I don't want to screw it up!  The online reviews are really scary for just about everything, and in addition to this, I'll be moving near a college town and I really don't want to end up in the student ghetto - I'm done with that!

I've got a budget ($900 a month or less), size (2 bedroom, 1 bath), and other requirements (dog friendly, prefer dishwasher, W/D hookups) and know I want to be close to my job so I can come home at lunch to take out the dog.

But how do I go about actually checking out apartments when I cannot visit them easily?
I will be in the same situation myself very shortly and some ideas I've gotten from friends are:

1) padmapper.com

2) Craigslist for a roommate and skype the guy/girl beforehand, make them give you a tour with their webcam

3)  airbnb.com - stay lengths can vary based on your needs and what you establish with the person you stay with, there are reviews of hosts and host ID verification

"How to deal with shady employer My   employer fucked me. We do IT, so we've always been able to do our work 100% remotely... but our elderly cave-people bosses were always too scared to try it. When Covid hit they sent us all home and lo and   behold, productivity skyrocketed , costs went down, and none of the huge   disasters they feared ever happened. And they publicly acknowledged that full-time Work From Home was a tremendous success. When we asked if they would keep it they promised they would. So when I got a much higher paying   job offer from an organization that didn't do WFH I passed on it.

Now   they're telling us that the week after next we will be forced to come   back into the office 4 days per week. We're all furious. My wife is   preg t and we're in the USA so I can't just walk out - we need the   health insurance. They make our lives miserable in a hundred ways, but   this bald-faced lie hits different. I can't stand the thought of having   to look those lying fucks in the face every day while I waste hours on   commutes and dealing with their pointless pop-bys and all the other  time  wasting. I feel trapped and powerless. So...

Your friend should look into trading in his vehicle for an older one that is lower priced, and cheaper to insure. The dealership will contact a bank who buys the car at a reduced value and the difference will be added to the price of the new/cheaper car. Refi cing may be an option as well if cr",1

Frankly, whether it's true or not, you should just tell them you were laid off or come up with a good excuse as to why you left.

Tips?
I don't like it either - I just deflect politely and maybe with a little humor if I feel someone is asking questions that I consider too personal. Deflect, and redirect the conversation toward a topic that you are more comfortable with.

If there's an opportunity for you to teach them something or to respectfully set a boundary, take it.

A while ago for about a month I worked out daily, and then I just got tired of it and stopped. What's a surefire way to get into working out? I know sometimes having a workout partner can help, but I really prefer exercising alone.
Tip 1: It's all about the mindset.
You don't work out because you want to look good or be healthy, you work out because it's your lifestyle.  It's just something you do, same like you eat, you poop, you work out.

So you feel lazy today, huh?  Did you eat today?  Did you poop?  Well you work out, because that's what you do.  You don't think about it.  Oh damn, sitting at the sofa and forgot to work out, you don't give up on your lifestyle, it's what you do.

Tip 2:  Don't go too hard working out early on or in general when you don't feel it.  Train your mind to believe it's not an hour long of agony.  If you're working out for 5 minutes and are just not feeling it, stop.  Some days you feel good, some days you just don't feel it.  You'll feel it out, but go.  Even for 5 minutes.  Next time your limit will be 10 minutes.  Ease into it so your mind doesn't associate it with something that's too much or too hard.  It's your lifestyle.

"How to parallel park perfectly every time. I am hopeless at parking and was wondering if anyone had some good tips!
It really depends on the length of your car and more importantly, the amount of car that goes beyond your rear wheels.  You'll have to practice a few times to figure out where to adjust but basically my process goes like this. 

1. Pull up next to the car I am parking behind, aligning the rear of both cars, ~ 2 feet away.
2. Turn the wheel all the way to the right (if parking on the right).
3. Reverse until the car is at a 45 degree angle to the parking space.
4. Turn wheels straight and reverse car until front bumper clears the car in front. 
5. Turn wheels to the left all the way and reverse car the rest of the way into the spot.  

The places you'll most likely need to adjust based on your car length and turning radius is how far forward or backward to align your car (step 1), how much distance you need in between the two cars (step 1), and how far to reverse before straightening the wheel (step 3).",1

Any easier way to know?
Starting and open and honest communication with your brother is your best bet. Might seem awkward to bring up, but just mention that you wanna know when he's home or not so you know if it's sweet to have a quiet night with the gf or not. say that you aren't up to anything dodgy if you text asking if he's home or what time he'll be back and it's simply to know if privacy is available.. let him know it goes both ways so if he's wanting to have a girl over he can do the same.

I need some life pro tips for making a cheap-ass not energy-saving fridge more efficient, thanks! Besides not opening it much which I do rarely and only for short periods of time, thanks in advance  !
Keep the insulation strips on the door/s  clean and flexible.   Make sure there is no loose spots or cracks.   An old test for this was taking a dollar bill - close the door on the bill, and see how easily the bill can be pulled out while the strip is pressing on it.  Too easy = leak.     If you find the stripping is broken or less-flexible, ask the owner to repair it.   

Keep a little space in front of fans inside for air flow, and allow some air flow on each shelf while trying to occupy as much space as possible inside the 'fridge & freezer.   Filling containers with water and putting them inside as place holders can work as a 'thermal sink';  the cold water or ice will help keep the temperature from changing much around it.   Space that is empty will warm up and require a lot more re-cooling;  space occupied by food or water needs less frequent re-chilling. 

Make sure that any fans, trays and radiator tubes/fins are clean.  Clean & dust under and behind - along the entire back of the fridge frequently  ( once/month or so), and check underneath for a drip tray or filter - also keep that clean.",1

To streamline the process at security:

* Wear shoes you can easily slip on and off (but wear socks too, if you don't want to be briefly barefoot on gross airport floors)  
* empty out all water/drink bottles beforehand (you can refill them at a water fountain after security)
* have all your stuff organized so you aren't juggling it  
* Take all the coins out of your pockets. I used to forget to do this all the time

Other random advice

* Bring your own snacks or meals (if it isn't an international flight then they will only give you 1 drink and a tiny snack, sometimes not even that) Food is needlessly expensive in airports.
* earplugs or noise canceling headphones are really nice to have. Earplugs or in-ear earbuds supposedly help prevent pressure discomfort, but I just wear them because planes are so loud it's exhausting.
* on a long flight, try to stretch your legs and walk up and down the aisle every couple of hours, unless you're sleeping or there's turbulence. Helps make your muscles less tired from sitting in a confined space for so long
* a carry-on that will fit under the seat in front of you is highly preferable to one that can only go in the overhead bin. Don't use the overhead bin if you can avoid it, it's such a hassle and wastes time while deplaning",1

These are the people you don't need to waste time with. Don't put them off, but don't go out of your way to make friends with them or play their games. Just do your thing and if it turns out that the toxic people are the ones ruling the roost, your best bet is to look for employment elsewhere because even if you become the king of office politics, that will just make you the king of assholes (or worse, entrenched in a company that has made bad business and fi cial decisions alongside bad hiring decisions).

"What to do about you best friend giving you the cold shoulder from nowhere? Me and my best friend, let's call him Giffel, have always had a great bond/connection since 6 years back. We went to the same highschool and have been enrolled at the same university too, where we study our seperate programmes. 

We usually have alot to say to each other, even if we didn't we would always have the ""willpower"" to chat if we messaged each other. We have the same interests and we could complete each others sentances in an eerie yet fascinating way. We could talk on skype for hours and he would come over to my house from time to time.

But for about 1-2 years now he has gone completely silent. Well, I mean it feels like he don't have time for me or rather that he doens't want to give time to me. Answering a question or a simple ""Hello m8, wassup?"" can take hours and our conversations are mainly based off of ""Lmao, Rofl, Lol and xD"". I have quite alot to say but and usually write my sentances to my hearts content. His answers make think that I might actually be irritating him and that he answers just.... For the heck of it so I don't ""complain"" so to say. 
I would never really ask/tell anyone about this kind of matter, but you see, it feels so weird valuing someone so much and show appreciation while at the same time feel that he doesn't even show half the appreciation you have towards him. How would you go around about this awkward and weird situation?
Do you see this person in real life ever, or just chat online? Sounds like you may have drifted apart, which happens all the time.

There are different tactics, depending on your personality.  

Toxic people want you to feel bad about yourself.  It elevates them to think they're better than you.  So don't give it to them.  I'm too stubborn to let people know they get to me, even if they did.  I don't let them win.

You can take every insult thrown at you, and throw it back.  I'm not talking about saying ""I'm not the loser. You're the loser!""  Because then you just sound like a loser.

What you do is as soon as they say something, you just roll your eyes and say in a bored voice  ""Yeah, I'm a loser, cocksucker, etc. etc.  People like you never think up any fresh material do you?""  Then stroll away like you found the whole thing a massive bore.  If they try some fresh material, use the same bored voice and tell them they're still boring you.

I've been close to my friend in question for years now and we talk all the time. I've started to see my friend including his new friend in some of the activities I've always wanted to do with him. Often times when I ask my friend to be included I feel really shitty afterwards and I feel like I was too pushy. I feel like if my friend doesn't ask first I'm imposing or I'm pushy.

I’ve expressed that I feel left out when I’m not asked to participate with my friend in his activities and it seems like we were able to work out the bigger issue, but I still feel like asking him is pushy. I have this underlying fear that if I never asked and waited for him to ask me, he would think I lost interest or just doesn’t care anymore. I’m really stumped on how to make things right. I understand he won’t always be able to include me in his activities but I still want to feel like he’ll remember me next time, right now it doesn’t feel so certain that it will because I’m always asking.

"How to not care about what others think nan
Sometimes, what others think matters, no matter how much you wish it didn't. That's life. Your job is to sort whose opinions matter, what areas are appropriate for them to have meaningful opinions to you, how objectively valid these are (including ethics), how much and what kind of change is being effectively requested, and how much change or no change matters to you vs them vs overall group (like the company or family). If it's an opinion not worth all this consideration, then okay you simply should care less... 

And, in that case where you simply to need to learn how to not care so much (and on subjects that are not going to affect your future), it can be fun to deliberately choose options that conflict with the opinion. Not necessarily opposed, but different.  ... For subjects that do affect your future, get as many opinions as possible - as qualified as possible - so that no one opinion is given much power and you get to select one, not feel forced on a particular one.",1

A few things you should know initially:

* Soda keeps its carbonation in a vacuum. Once the bottle is opened, over time the carbonation will degenerate. Meaning the more soda is gone from your bottle, the less carbonation there will be. 

* Soda will fizz when in contact with ice that is dry. Wet the ice with some water before putting it into the Soda. 

My advice is if it really is a problem for you, stop pouring your soda into glasses. Get cans, or small bottles of your favorite soda and drink it out of those. This will prevent more un-vacuumed air from drawing out the carbonation as a 2L bottle with the more you drink, since its in a smaller container.",1

"How to remove the turkey grease from car upholstery prior to my mother in law taking my life. I made a turkey for the first time this Christmas and so I didn't exactly know what I was doing. There were many bumps in the road to this festive meal, the largest of which involved me getting turkey grease all over the seats of my SO's truck, my pants, and his coat. I'm sure it's pretty obvious why I'd prefer my mother in law not to know about these events. 


There is a huge spill down the thigh of my jeans which is the least of a priority. There is a pretty bad spot on the pouch of his hoodie and the truck seats are a disaster. The worst part is that he's only had this truck for 2 months and he's kept it super clean. Needless to say he's not really happy about the stain and the fact that his truck smells like turkey grease. 


Apparently, the tin foil I put on it wasn't secure enough to keep the grease from spilling on the way to her house Christmas Eve so that's how long the stain has been there. Is there anything to take this stuff out? I tried washing the clothes but obviously it wasn't very helpful. I'm at a loss about the truck though and I'd really like for my Suzy Homemaker mother in law not to know about all this.
To wash it out of your clothes, try Dawn. Rub a little into each grease stain and let it sit for maybe 5 minutes or so. Then into the washer with your normal detergent. That should do it. Make sure you don't go overboard with the Dawn or you may have to clean your floors too. HA HA!

If that still doesn't get it, don't run them through the dryer cycle. Look up Dawn and hydrogen peroxide use on google. That should do it. Just use a small brush when the grease spots hardens up in the peroxide.",1

Because of depression i didn't brushed them for 6 months and lost the need to brush them then i did once a month then it became once a week and now im close to almost daily for atleast 10 minutes to make sure i hit every part of the gums and every tooth. 
I bought the whitening set without any expectations, but after a while i noticed some difference. And now i hope i can manage my time to do atleast 2 times a day! I hope this can work for you too.
Maybe dont tell yourself you NEED to brush, but maybe you can tell yourself you WANT to brush so you can have a fresh breath for the people around you, you WANT to brush so you can have clean teeth to show off. You WANT to brush so you can get whiter teeth if you use the above like i did. Again, i hope this works for you because laughing is a good medicine and clean teeth will help with confidence to do that.

This depends on the type of school you're going to be attending and what you're looking to get out if it (besides education). I'd say study hard, be yourself, and don't try to impress anyone. Good friends and lifelong memories will happen on their own.

"Note taking and study techniques that involve as little writing as possible. Apparently between my aggressive note taking style and my knitting hobby, I’ve given myself a nice case of Tennis Elbow. While I’m in physical therapy I have to take it easy on the writing and knitting (and any other activities that exacerbate the pain). The therapist suggested recording myself reading my notes and listen to them, unfortunately I find the sound of my voice too offputting to listen to. 

Can anyone suggest any studying and note taking methods that are not copying every thing by hand or recording myself?  Thanks?
you can condition yourself using a memory palace method, so you can commit the item to memory instead of writing them down - Method of loci - combine your note taking to shorten your notes to single/fewer words to activate the memory..... also picture paints a thousand words so maybe illustrations and diagrams may work too...",1

"How to shave (male) nan
In addition to some of the excellent comments made earlier:

Buy a decent safety razor. Maybe your father or grandfather still has one laying in a drawer somewhere. A good razor lasts several lifetimes. Good brands are Merkur, Muhle or Edwin Jagger. 

Also: buy good Double Edge blades. There are many online shops that sell sample packs. Every shaver has his favourites, but the consensus seems that Astra and Feather blades are particularly good for heavy beards. This is a matter of personal preference though.
Added bonus: a pack of DE blades is dirt cheap. You can buy blades at $10 for 100 pieces. An average blade lasts two or three shaves. Prior to switching to DE, I used cartridge razors that were a few euros each that would not last a single shave.

As for soap: a good old-fashioned shaving soap is way better than shaving foam or gel from an aerosol. Again: a good soap is dirt cheap and lasts a long time. I found that skin rashes and eczema were disappearing after using a good soap for a month. A good after shave lotion does wonders as well. Some have a bit of witch hazel mixed in, which speeds up recovery for the skin.

As for the shave itself: do not hurry and do not apply too much pressure. Let the blade do the work. Otherwise, you *will* cut yourself.",1

"How can I deal with a friend who won't refrain from smoking around me? I'm a non smoker, and being around cigarette smoke gives me a headache, and makes me feel nauseous and gross and grumpy.  My friend smokes in her house. She has several children, so she limits smoking to her bedroom. So that's where we visit.  I've offended offered for her to visit at my place, but she often can't because of the kids. For a long time now I've been wanting to say something, but I know she'll be resistive/defensive. I once asked her to use one of those smoking buddies to exhale her smoke into, and she flat out refused. 

Today she asked me to come over after she was done work to visit, and I straight up told her how I feel. I tried to emphasize that I didn't want to offend her, but I just couldn't do it anymore. Sometimes I get anxiety thinking about having to go to her house and sit in the stag t smoke. I told her that I was starting to associate her house with feeling ill. She said it would only be her there smoking (as opposed to her husband as well and sometimes another friend smoking), and inquired if it was really that bad. I replied that yes, one person was bad enough to make me feel sick. And then the conversation ended. She never replied. 

I feel like it's going to come down to me choosing whether I want to visit her and sacrifice my health, or not visit at all.  We've been friends since early high school, almost 20 years. I can't help but feel that a good friend wouldn't put this addiction ahead of a friendship, all the while expecting the friend to sacrifice their well being?  Is asking her to refrain from smoking around me, and going outside or in the garage asking too much?

Much gratitude to anyone that can give me any tips on dealing with this issue.
I hear you! It makes me ill too. Bleh, can't stand that shit. If it were me, I'd probably just stop hanging around her because I just can't take that. But Skype and phone are good solutions. Or hang around in places where she has to go outside to smoke, like a restaurant.",1

Jewelry designer here who works at a company with a similar policy. 

The discounted price you get is still going to be above the raw material cost. For example my company marks up our jewelry 400%, and my discount is ~60-70%, so essentially what I’m being charged for is raw material +labor. If a piece cost $100 in material, and it was marked up 400%, with my employee discount I’d still pay $120+taxes. The market value of the gold would be $100, then when I factor in refiners fees (typically 20%), i would end up making only $80 on something paid $120 for. Even if you could sell it on eBay you won’t get retail value. I’d be very surprised if you could make enough money reselling for it to be worth it. And it would look real suspicious if anyone asked why you aren’t wearing any of the pieces you’re buying.",0

The tips from SoupIsNotAMeal are all excellent. I would add two more.

I went through a 3 day course on presentations because I wasn't very good at it. I learned the most beneficial tip on the last day and I use it every time I give a presentation. One of the problems that inexperienced or nervous presenters have is that they pan the audience when presenting. This floods the brain with information overwhelming it. Your best bet is to find one or two sympathetic/nodding people in the front row. Focus your gaze on one and give that person your full idea. Then give your next idea to the second person.

"Why do people not approach me naturally in parties/informal meetings to connect? I'm 35/m, in a mid level mgt position. I think I have good communication skills. And I've always felt highly awkward in social situations (office parties particularly). 

I will normally approach a ton of people at parties and open the conversation, ask lots of questions to learn about that person and so on.

However I realized over the years that at almost any party, there's hardly anyone who will walk up to me, say hello and start conversing.

This is making it very hard for me to think of myself as a confident/likeable person and also making it hard for me to make genuine connections/friendships.

Are there any people who experience the same? What do you do?
Is there anyone you would trust in your life to give you really, brutally honest feedback on your social skills?  Sometimes we do things that are off-putting, and we don't even realize it without someone pointing it out... 

There were a couple people at my old work place that I would actively avoid despite them being friendly ""on paper,"" i.e. they try to be social, but end up making people uncomfortable anyway.  One guy is a very know-it-all personality.  He makes small talk with people, but it's uncomfortable because it always feels like he's trying to show off obscure knowledge or one-up someone.  

Then there's a girl that never modulates the tone of her voice and puts a negative spin on everything she talks about.  (She also dresses rather slobbishly and pulls her hair back super tight everyday.  It's makes being around her a very unsettling experience.)

I'm not saying that you do any of these things, but it's possible you have an unsettling quirk that someone you know could point out to you if you ask for some honest feedback (be willing to accept the criticism if you do this though!).",1

None of the generations that have used it have learned how to keep them out and completely sealing everything (floor, walls, roof) would cost $100,000+. Anyone have good tips on how we can keep the mice out?

Ultimately I felt this contributed to me getting an edge in the job interview to a small extent.

Now I’m worried about the implications of this. Beyond getting a passable wedding ring how do I deal with the Christmas parties, happy hours and other office related activities that may involve spouses?

TL;DR - I’m an idiot. Please help me.
The easy way? Make excuses for a while, and then pretend you got a divorce. Make up a story that she cheated on you, yada yada yada

The pro way? Escort. Take pictures to show/put on your wallpaper, etc. Bring her to some work events, and the others, say that she's out of town for work.

Eventually, you can transition into the 'divorce' narrative.",0

"What tricks do you use to keep a conversation going when making small talk? I'm pretty socially inept and rife with anxieties but trying to better myself. My biggest issue is when making small talk: I have no idea what to say nor how to hold the conversation without it going flat or how to pick it back up again after it stops. What are some of your best tips when trying to keep a conversation flowing with people you aren't super familiar with?
Don't be afraid of the awkward silence. If you wait 5-10 seconds after the topic at hand has run its course, chances are the other party will resume the conversation with a new topic before you have the time to blurt something out you didn't mean to.

I used to always try and keep everyone talking, which led to a lot of awkward silences leading to awkward conversations. As a very talkative person, I realized it was to my advantage to just be quiet for the 5-10 seconds between topics and letting the other parties speak up and talk about a topic of theirs.

I also often think ""what would I want to be asked"", which can lead to people really becoming open and happy to talk and gush about things they love.",1

"How do I improve the mind-muscle connection with my chest when working out? I've had a pretty big issue in the gym for several months now, and that is that I cannot, no matter **what**, establish a proper mind-muscle connection with my pecs and actually feel them when working out unlike pretty much any other muscle (yes, even my calves).

I've tried pretty much every chest exercise you can think of, from simple pushups, to incline/decline dumbbell flies/pushes, to cable crossovers and flies.

Regardless of the technique, position, weight, or the form, all exercises end up simply tiring out my arms/shoulders after a few sets and simply do not hit the pecs at all.

I've asked several trainers and experienced lifters in my gym for advice and most of them said I need to work on my mind-muscle connection and simply do the exercises until I manage to activate my pecs.

Now, *to be fair*, when I do the exercises and put my hand on my pecs *they are usually contracting a bit*, especially during the cable flies/crossovers, its just that I simply cannot feel my working out.

However, during all the other exercises (benching, dumbbell, etc.) its like my body simply ignores pecs all together.

The only indication I have that my chest workout was at least somewhat successful is the slight pressure/pain that I feel if I take a deep breath.

"How do I get my business phone number off the telemarketers lists, specifically Google? Business numbers are exempt from the DNC list and I will never buy from anyone who ignores my request to stop calling yet they call all day every day.
The key to getting off telemarketer lists **is for them to think your number is out of service or disconnected**.  Once they get that ""Boo-Dah-Deep...the number you have reached is not in service"" message, they remove it from their lists.  And, since most lists get shared with other telemarketers, your number falls off their radar after a while.

I use a VOIP provider called [Anveo](http://www.anveo.com) for my home and business lines.  One of the neat features they and other VOIP companies offer is greater control over what happens when someone calls your number(s).

For example, I can have calls ring my office phone during business hours, then ring my cell phone after hours until 11PM, and then go to voice mail overnight.

With Anveo, all I have to do is blacklist a telemarketer's number.  The next time they call, they get the ""number is disconnected"" message and the magic starts.

When I went to file a claim afterwards, I noticed that my pet insurance policy stated that my pet must be under 14 years of age at the time of enrolment. This is an issue as my cat is 15 years old which was also reflected in the paperwork I received from the pet hospital required to file a claim. She was enrolled in the pet insurance a few weeks prior to the hospital trip. How serious of an offence would it be to photoshop her age to say that she is 13 years old and is there any way that the insurance company could find out I’m lying? TIA

Remember not to place blame on anything specific. Breakups happen for multiple reasons. Remember all these reasons and try your best to see them for what they are. Accept it, forgive yourself in your own time for any struggles you had, and invest in your health overall.

I work in Restaurants for 15 years and when a customer makes a mess or spills something, after you let us know and we are there, just let us do our job.

From a customers perspective, it’s weird to see other patrons cleaning in a store/restaurant. Accidents happen.

Some time ago I was working on a horse farm down south. The trainer as well as her senior staff abuse the horses under the guise of “training”. They are an expert in keeping it hidden from the public eye, and when I was first hired there was a “honeymoon period” before true colors came out a few months later.

The things this trainer and her senior staff do is… horrific. Brutal and cruel. I have video and picture evidence from likeminded people who saw what was going on and filmed. It’s been quite some time since I had any involvement with that place, it honestly haunts me the things I have seen and was forced to be a bystander to.

Not so much ""unethical"" than more ""playing the system"" so to speak.

Some background: I've been at my current company for about 1.5 years and I'm beginning to yearn for a new year new job opportunity. I managed to go through the phone screening with HR and hiring manager and am invited for a panel in-person interview now scheduled for early January for a new position. It was originally going to be next week but there were understandable conflicts with the coming holidays.

Now the thing is at my sector of work, most bonuses are given in February along with compensation adjustments/promotions/etc. I would sure be bummed to miss out on a bonus I am more than deserving of if I got an offer for an earlier start date than say mid-February.

What are some ways I can hold off on any potential job offers to time it with getting my current company's bonus and then leave? I was thinking I can use their interview delay as leverage to counter with excuses such as having pre-planned vacation time, giving more than 2 weeks notice from current company.

Anything else? Thanks in advance!

https://urchin.earth.li/~twic/How_To_Staple_Really_Thick_Bundles_Of_Paper.html

> make holes for the arms through the stack before stapling. For this, you will need a sharp implement of roughly the same diameter as the staple's arms, but much greater rigidity. My preferred tool is a 21-gauge syringe needle; a 25 will do, but a 21 is that bit wider. Yet wider needles may be even better, but would involve a trip to stores. A sewing needle is almost certainly also effective.

> Getting the holes the right distance apart is critical; this is easily done by using a staple as a ruler, or, if you've already tried and failed to staple the bundle in the normal manner, simply use the failed staple holes as guides for the needle. The best way to do the puncturing seems to be to place the bundle on top of a soft but reasonably rigid object, like a lump of expanded polystyrene or a seat cushion or something, and then push the needle through the paper into it; this keeps the paper flat, whilst not buggering the needle.",1

Till this day I've been using a fan to cool myself, however I do not find it very effective since the room itself is still hot. Because of this I'm looking for an alternative.

I could use a airco but I do not want to screw something in the wall or have an outdoor unit so I have to choose for a mobile airco. You have an exhaust hose for the mobile airco which has to be ~4 meters long in order for me to exhaust it outside (bed is in front of the only window) which makes that a bit more difficult.

My best solution (I think) is a mobile airco without a hose (which does not exist?) or a air cooler. Air cooler got me confused alot. Several people are saying they make the room feel cooler, while others say it does not lower the temperature. It also brings water in the air, which will make condense on materials or damage electronics if it gets too much ?

"How can a great worker move into management? nan
Here's what I did when I got to the point when I realized I wanted to get into a management role:

1. Make your intentions of wanting to become a manager known to your manager. He or she typically has behind the scenes access to info you might not be aware of (manager openings, other opportunities, etc). 

2. Ask if there is any additional work or tasks you can take on to help prepare you for the next step. For example, I'm in sales and I asked my manager if there was anything extra that I could do. He said he would put me in charge of the store's paperwork and sales contests. Not only did this help me develop, it also took some tasks off my manager's plate. Win-win. 

When a manager opening came around, I could tell the person I was interviewing with that not only do I have excellent sales numbers, but I'm also in charge of the store's paperwork and driving sales through contests. Helped me to be a more rounded employee and gave me talking points because I could say, ""in January I took on the task of driving sales through fun contests, and our sales numbers increased x% month over month."" 

3. Network! Meet other managers and employees at the company. The more advocates you have in your corner, the better. 

These are basics and I'm sure there are others out there who can provide other tips, but these are the 3 most helpful tips that helped me get promoted.",1

He lives at home with my mother who is fucking amazing, but she cannot say no; so whatever new video game he wants, he gets. He has his own big screen, Xbone, PS4, Laptop and Desktop PC that my mother has all purchased for him. 

He has no friends outside of digital ones. Doesn't have his license, so he cannot drive, my mother drives him to COLLEGE. 

My mother doesn't share my concerns because she says that he's going to school. I think that's awesome, and he's doing well, BUT, who the hell is going to hire someone with a degree, and 0 work experience? No one. 

He was supposed to be looking for jobs this summer, but he's procrastinating doing that, and my mother is not pushing it either. 

Any suggestions, or tips to light that fire under his feet? I feel like I need to have a come to Jesus moment or something. I don't want to end up with the stereotypical, 30 yr old little brother who lives at home and plays video games all day.
Talk to him in a manner that isnt ""I don't want to be a brother of..."" Your concerns are valid but you kinda came off like a dick there. Be clear about the job experience thing, video games aren't necessarily the problem, it's being responsible. 

I don't have a great answer, but I will say it didn't help me when my family members weren't straightforward. If they acted overly concerned and just said ""you shouldn't play as many games, go work or hang out with friends like a normal person"" I wouldn't listen to it. 

If he's doing okay in school compliment him. Maybe offer teaching him to drive as well? I know that's rough if you can't commit your time/vehicle, but it'd be nicer than mommy or daddy helping cause they have to.",1
"I need to be more awake in the parties. I get some good sleep in the night previous to the parties... before going to the pre-party, I drink coffee. In the preparty I eat well, get hydrated and drink very little. But once I reach the real party, give me an hour or two (wether I drink or not), and I become a zombie, to the point I can't have a conversation and I want to get out of there and sleep. I get out at 1AM, while everyone else stands until 4/5AM.
Even if I force myself to stand there, I feel like a rock since I can't stand myself focused on the conversation with girls or my pals. Please teach me.
I actually think this could be stress related:

You don't feel at home at the event and either get bored (leading to feeling tired), or you are so anxious to have a good time, that you tense up and try too hard - making you tired.

Make sure you don't go alone, but with a friend, or a couple of friends, that you also see outside of the parties. Talk about the parties and events and maybe share your feelings about those. Sometimes you'll find that the events are *""not your thing""* simply because of the people, the location, or maybe the music.

Also, social stress is common for people with other anxiety issues (phobias, allergies, etc.) or even due to a disorder related to autism.

Making New Friends as an Adult


* **Local events.** See if your town has a local newspaper, events scene, or ongoing event calendar. Choose what you'd like to attend! Maybe there's a weekend market, a blues fest, a trivia night, movie in the park, a garden club. If you're really lucky, maybe there's a neighborhood block party or BYOB.  

* **Volunteering.** If your town has a food bank, a community farm, a school in need of helpers, a park in need of cleanup, whatever! Spend some time helping the community flourish.

* **3rd Spaces.** These are neither work nor home, but spaces you can exist in the community. Maybe a bar? A library? Coffee shop? Park? Nature trail? Go hang out. You can be introverted and spend time in these spaces.

* **Meetup Groups.** Check out meetup groups in your community. Folks are looking for friends - maybe even start your own around your interests! Choose one or two to test the waters.

* **Gym.** If you're sports-friendly, you could join a class or a small team. Instant friends. Sometimes there are pick-up kickball, frisbee, or soccer games in town.",1

"How to stop being so emotional when it comes to animals nan
Well, I am sort of similar to you. I  can not stand the abuse, neglect or death of animals, specifically dogs. My user name is only due to my extreme love of dogs.  When my kids were younger and watch PBS, I would be a wreck when the animal abuse commercials came on...when shelters ask for donations, adoptions, I feel a sadness that is overwhelming.  I have been this way my entire life....my sister was mean to animals growing up, and insects. I was the nerd child who would not stand for her torturing ants, flies, moths, caterpillars or snails.  We had rabbits, the mother smothered her babies...I was 8 and I fell apart. At 9, our cat got run over by a car....again, I fell apart for months. When our dog got hit by a car, in front of my 10 year old eyes....I felt my first severe panic/anxiety attack. He survived, but I am still always fighting the fear of animals getting hit by cars. I hate seeing squirrels dead on the street, bunnies are so adorable, I want to pick one up and pet their tails....So, to answer your question.....I have no clue. the only thing that has helped me to be less emotional in EVERY area of my life is taking Cymbalta, an antidepressant that also treats anxiety. I can tolerate animal neglect, abuse, etc. better, although I am still insanely in love with dogs. I also have a story involving me, a van and a dead dog, which has made me reluctant and nervous of driving in recent years....don't ask..Getting older can also change us...",1

"Despite being an alien I just got the Stimulus Cheque. US Redditors, I need to ask you about something. I was working in Summer in the USA in 2018. After the summer was finished I came back to Poland in September that year, filled taxes, got nice return and that was the last time I had anything to do with the States. 
Until today when I surprisingly got a letter from IRS with a fat stimulus cheque inside. And I am baffled, I did not apply for it but got it anyway! What am I supposed to do? My employment was not impacted by the virus as I wasn't planning to go to the US anyway. I am not a resident, I am not an American. 1200$ is a lot of money, am I allowed to keep it? Or should I return it? I am really afraid of the US feds if keeping it turns out to be illegal, as my country is a close ally to the USA and we have a lot of laws facilliating extradition and punishment for criminals/tax frauds. Looking for a life pro tip and I felt like here is the best place, because keeping it even despite possibly no legal consequences feels a bit... immoral. 
What should I do?
The stimulas check was based off of 2018 and 2019 tax returns. If you got a check it's because you had a tax return in that year. You didn't have to sign up for it. It was automatic.

My suggestion. Keep the money in a savings account, wait a bit of time(6months) and if no info is given. I would say you are in the clear. That being said, lots of states and federal agencies are starting to backtrack and trace funds. I'm not sure if this is one of those areas they are going to be doing that with.

For past employers, I know they sometimes call to verify dates of employment, or get a reference if it's provided. But for a current employer, they would risk getting you fired if they called to check. So is this a safe tactic? Or will they likely double-check somewhere down the line?

"hide my reading at work My job is boring with plenty of downtime - i run big printers and literally watch ink dry. They banned books, phones, tablets, and music. I was reading using my local library and firefox but I was tipped off that they're onto me. How can I disguise my reading?

I probably can't change the angle without drawing more attention.
Download a copy of the book in plain text, and throw it into a .txt doc. Then resize the screen so it’s only displays a few sentences at a time.

"Can I send a letter to a te t in my apartment pretending to be the management? Howdy folks,

For about a year or two I’ve been dealing with two different te ts in my apartment complex that both (a) walk their dogs off-leash exclusively and (b) don’t take their pets to the designated pet-relief area (there is an astroturf patch that gets cleaned regularly). Because of this, I have had these dogs come up to me and try and jump on me, and start barking in my face. Aside from that,  they have also caused certain areas to reek of piss because they’re just dirt patches that soak it up and then sit in the sun all day

I have had multiple civil conversations with both. Although they seem to understand, the next time I see them their dog is off leash peeing/pooping wherever they like and not getting picked up.

My proposed solution after contacting management about this a few times with no real follow up is to take matters into my own hands anonymously. I just wrote up a letter where I took the formatting from a Word document emailed directly from my management office and referenced the section in the te t handbook regarding pet policy. I then said that there have been complaints from pedestrians walking by (one of the dogs is aggressive and has come up to randoms walking by the apartments - the owner does not seem capable of keeping it under control) I stated that at this time, they would not be charged a fee (a real fee listed in the handbook) but if we continue to receive complaints, we will take action.

"What are your best tips for simplifying house chores? Hi folks!

On  a recent comment in another sub I was mentioning how house chores take so  much time and you end up with less free time to enjoy the things you do.  For families, kids can really take that to a whole new level of endless  cleaning and tidying.

I've been  trying to optimize how we do things at home in order to cut on time  needed to clean/organize/tidy later. Was curious to know what/how others  do as well.

Here's a few of my own

* get  a dishwasher - its great when someone loves to do dishes, but its not  our case. Delegating that do the dishwasher is a timesaver. Of course  there's still work involved but all in all I think we are better now
* clean  as you cook - every empty packet, can or whatever, immediately goes to  the bin. Dirty stuff goes to the dishwasher right way. In the end, its  easier to clean up the kitchen.
* for me, get only black socks - big timesaver, no more hours of trying to match pairs
* when we do laundry, clean underwear goes to a different basket from the rest of the clothes. easier to find and manage
* wipe your bathroom sink dry before going to bed (last person to use it) - it helps keeping it clean and with less stains
* cleaning  frenzy - I can't remember where I got this from (flylady?), its  basically a 10min period during the afternoon where we put some lively  music and all the family focus on cleaning up and organizing whatever we  feel like during these short bursts of time. Obviously you are not  doing a deep clean, its more just to put things in their place (toys!  clothing, etc...) We take turns choosing whats songs are played

"How to deal with loud and thoughtless apartment neighbors A bit of context: my across-the-hall neighbors are incredibly loud and irritating. The occupants are a single mom with five kids, and a sometimes-present boyfriend/father(?). While I honestly have no idea how hard it would be to raise all these children on your own, and do sympathize, the mother has made no attempts to keep the kids from being irritating little shits. From leaving the door open while they yell and scream, to running around up and down the stairs, to leaving trash and clothing everywhere, to letting their gigantic Rottweiler off the leash, I have had it.

I've tried to talking to her politely, and neither her nor the landlord could give two fucks about the situation.

"best way to warm up my freezing thighs When I'm working a job outdoors during the winter months my thighs get extremely cold to the point that I can ""feel"" it in my bones. So when I get home I strip out of my work clothes and take a hot shower then burrito myself in the blankets. However, to no avail my thighs do not warm up. So reddit, does anyone have a   to help me with my daily dilemma?
Have you considered having something hot in the blankets with you? A hot water bottle covered in a long sock works very well for assisting sleeping in freezing temperatures. You can make the water quite hot due to the insulation of the sock; boiling is not out of the question as long as your sock is thick enough that it doesn't hurt your skin. You can wrap it in a blanket to distribute the heat or use more than one if you get tired of moving it around.

There are flexible or pouch-like water bottles; if you're wearing something like snowpants or anything big and heavy on this job, you might be able to put them in large pockets or hook them to your belt. 

However, if you have to move a lot or this isn't practical, a simpler solution is to fill small cloth pouches with un-popped popcorn (plain/bulk) and heat them in the microwave for a short time, 30 seconds or less at once. Great hand warmers, and they work in pockets for thighs. Short lived (20-30 mins) and probably not perfect, but it makes a difference.",1

Hey, I’m also monitored for my talk time. I’m a talker so I never have problems with it, but here’s some tips that really add up over time:

-	leave lengthy voicemails about who you are and why you’re calling if allowed
-	let their entire voicemail greeting play before hanging up (hang up right before the beep) (that counts  as a pickup on most systems like Talkdesk - it can’t tell the difference)
-	Ask open ended questions, not yes/no questions. It encourages people to talk. Instead of “are you having a good day so far?” say “how is your day?” Instead of “Do you have any questions for me?” say “What questions do you have?” Never ask a yes/no question unless it’s truly unavoidable

I average around 10 hours of talk each week while my team average is 3. I’m also generally a bubbly talkative guy, and I very genuinely will have off topic discussions with the people that I’m calling. People don’t want you to be a robot, and you don’t either.

If there was a little more left, I would suggest putting a rubberband over the tip of a screwdriver and trying. But that's pretty far gone. 

If you have a dremmel tool, try cutting a slot into it and removing it with a regular screw driver.

Otherwise, for $10 I would recommend getting a [left-handed drill bit](http://www.amazon.com/OEM-25771-Five-Piece-Handed-Titanium/dp/B0014WH9AC/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1360537890&sr=8-7&keywords=left+hand+drill+bits) or a [Grabit.](http://www.amazon.com/Alden-8402P-Grabit-Damaged-Extractor/dp/B001NMLHHO/ref=sr_1_10?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1360538541&sr=1-10&keywords=grabit) I've had good results with both. Since the screw is in wood, once you get a bite on it, it should come out pretty easily.

As a last resort, you could just try to pry the whole thing off and fix the damage done by the screws. If you're lucky, you might be able to get it to move enough to get a set of vice grips over the screw head to back it out. Or if you pull them all the way out, it could be as easy as sticking a couple of toothpicks in there with some glue. But that should be the last resort as you could do more damage.",1

I really don't care how it looks, I just need it to be tight against the wall when I run it up and around door frames and along the wall. I'm thinking something that can secure it to the wall maybe every 3 or 4ft. I'm looking for something I don't have to drill into the wall, and won't leave any marks when removed.

Thanks!
I agree with the others, you could use command strip hooks and then ziptie the wires to the hooks.
You could use WireMold raceway, which would look the nicest, but I agree with NaturalSelectorX that it may damage the wall when removed, but you could just leave it there when you move out, most landlords won't mind if is nice and neat.   
The third option is to use a specialized staplegun that uses U shaped staples specifically made for cables like Cat5. The marks it leaves when removed are very tiny.  
The fourth option is to use a device which will run Cat 5 between any two points through the regular electrical wiring.  It's called PowerLine or something like that.

I used to be a lot more confident when I was younger but ever since moving and being on lockdown I feel as though I am socially stupid. I struggle with making new friends without being in a public school and I work with people much older than me. I try to socialise with people but I feel like I always miss the mark and am always overly anxious.

Ask if your sister would be safe there alone. People are more likely to share info based on the assumption they are protecting a female rather an a guy (learned this because I am a female and my male roommate and I accidentally duplicated calls). 

Yes, drive around at night, but check just after sunrise early Sunday. Beer cans? Loose dogs? Vomit or people passed out? Run away! 

Many places now charge not only an initial pet fee, but a monthly pet fee. 

Know your renter's rights! Many managers won't let guests stay more than 2 nights because in some states staying that 3rd night makes them a te t. That protects you from an unwanted roommate.

If you have roommates, make an agreement.  Don't put one person in charge of all utilities and collecting money. That person will get screwed if someone falls behind on bills.

How many nights is it ok for a roommate's significant other to stay? Penalty for not observing - increase in rent? Breaking  the lease early? 

No rule is a rule without an enforceable consequence.

"cheese sticking to sandwich maker's surface Reddit, I need you to enlighten my life. I own a sandwich maker like this: http://www.wellpromo.com/upload/upimg07/Sandwich-Maker-121307.jpg . I often fill the sandwich breads with ham and cheese slices. The thing is, the cheese ALWAYS spills out of the breads onto the heating surface, as it becomes liquid after heating it, and removing the cheese spills is pretty annoying, even though it's teflon surface. I found it is best done right after finishing the sandwich making, while the maker is still hot, but that prevents me from eating my sandwiches immediately. Do you have any trick as how to prevent cheese spilling all over the maker, or how to clean it easily? Perhaps by using some oil? That'd really help me out.

"how can I cause damage in my phone screen without warranty telling that it was intentional? I know this is an unethical question, but it's a very delicate issue:
I have purchased a Xiaomi Mi 8 a few weeks ago. I didn't buy a screen cover, because I literally never caused any scratches on my screen, or dropped the phone. For my biggest surprise, yesterday (after a long party) I seem to have severly scratched the screen. I knew that I f*cked up, so I looked for a repair company who does screen repairs on this device, but unfortunately no third party service centre offers this. There is a an official repair centre in my country, but it only does warranty repairs, no paid services.

"How to boost your mobile phone's internet reception when you are deep inside a building, ground floor metal roofs etc. nan
Here's the thing, if you're in an old building (such as an old fashioned movie theatre, old bank, etc), chances are you will have no reception because the building uses old fashioned building methods, involving lead pipes and other materials that reflect radio waves.

Now, if you're in a modern building, and you have little reception, try rebooting the phone--via hard reset. If your phone has a removable battery, remove the battery. If not, check online prior to visiting said building as to how to hard reset your phone. (Note: This does not mean FACTORY reset, this means completely shut off the phone as though there is no power at all.)

When the phone reboots, it will spend more time searching for a stable radio connection, as opposed to the default connection. Put the phone on a table or on the floor for best results, as your hands could interfere with the radio (with or without a bumper). 


And if it still doesn't work, check for WiFi.

I used the above method when I was on the first floor of my recently built dormitory, which had a TON of piping between the first and 2nd floor, which pretty much annihilated any sort of 4G. Hard resetting fixed it every time I had to stay on the first floor for long periods of time, as my room was on the 4th floor. :)",1
"How to talk to adults comfortably. First off I'm a teenager and I'm deathly afraid of talking to adults. I thing it is a combination of not sure what to talk about, but I also feel like they are always judging me. Whenever I talk one on one I don't know where to look. Whenever I look in their eyes I feel weird but when I look away it seems like I don't care about what they are saying. I also don't know how to sit/stand. I know people say to copy their posture but to me it seems like I'm mocking them. Maybe all of this is in my head but I'm never sure. Any help i can get would be great.
The best advice I can give you is to just act the way you would around someone of your own age, the most awkward thing you can do is to try and ""act"" like an adult. There's nothing wrong with being a teenager and acting like one. Adults generally don't judge teens for being teens, we expect them to be a little awkward at times, we've all been there ourselves, we remember what it was like.

As for what to talk about, just talk about the stuff you're interested in, I would always rather hear someone talk about stuff they're passionate about, even if I'm not interested in the subject, then have them try to talk about stuff they really don't care about.

If things do get awkward, just remember, life is full of awkward conversions, having them is just part of growing up. I run a company and employ about 20 people, I still feel awkward talking to half of them. It's ok to feel awkward and uncomfortable in certain social situations, it's a very normal part of everyday adult life.",1
"A way to hospitalize myself for a few weeks without permanent damage or death. I'm not going to be able to pass my college courses this semester because I accidentally submitted an exam that wasn't even 1/4 of the way done because hitting enter goes to the next question without warning and you can't back to previous question. I had a thick jacket on, so while I was working out a problem on paper, the bend at the elbow of my jacket was holding down enter on the number pad (I'm a lefty so mouse was on left, side paper on right) so I didn't feel that it was pressed down, thus skipping the entire rest of the test. They said that believed me but it wasn't something that I could retake since I had already seen the test. However, school policy does not allow repeating the course unless it is an extended leave due to a medical emergency. The thing is it's a program that is 3 days a week, for 6-10 hours a day and they allow 3 days to be made up (1 week's worth of school). Is there a way that I could hospitalize myself for 2 weeks or even just 9 days without the risk of dying or causing permanent damage to my body? (In other words I don't want to lose a limb or make myself un-fuckable.) Unreasonable school policy so I don't care about using unethical methods to pick myself back up.

"How do you keep eye glasses clean while on the go? I have been wearing glasses for about 20 years, and it seems to be a constant struggle to keep them clean.

If there's a magic bullet for this, I haven't found it yet. 

However, I have two best practices that help:

1) ""In the case or on your face."" Carry your glasses case around with you. If you take off your glasses, they go in the case. Helps keep them from getting dirty or lost or damaged.

2) Keep a microfiber cloth in the glasses case. The cloths stay a lot cleaner in the case than in your pocket. Use that cloth to wipe your glasses as needed during the day. You can put most of those microfiber cloths through a washing machine, though they usually need to air dry. Get a couple of spares so you can cycle them as they get dirty.",1

"Making a house smell nice. We recently bought a ~50-year-old house that had its original carpet. In addition to the original owners having smoked cigarettes in the house for those 50 years, they also had a dog who peed in the house. Repeatedly.

Most of the smoke smell is gone, but there are still hints of it. And now we have a vaguely unpleasant construction odor -- joint compound dust, paint, new carpet.

"How to battle a gaming addiction. Can't find any sources on Reddit on how to overcome the addiction.
So the real question I have is whether you want to stop or tone it down?

If you want to tone it down, I find setting reminders with an alarm on my phone to be good. Be realistic (not something like only 10 minutes, maybe at hour) but commit to it. Building this self control is just like working a muscle and you have to know that once the alarm goes you can't play for 24 hours. Single player games are awesome for this because you can just save it and say the rest is for another day. It's really important you don't (as I used to) try to weasel around it mentally (one more turn, another hour, finish this quest...) 

If you want to stop you need something else to fill the time; interests to make timesinks of. Literature or sports are both helpful. I've found martial arts to be rewarding. 

There's two really big hurdles you need to get over regardless of your goal; time and rewards.

Time is what surprised me, but games take a lot of it. My steam library has thousands of hours logged and that's only a fraction. You're going to have hours a day that you don't know what to do with. My advice is to get a list, not too long or too short ~6 items or goals, and use the new time to work toward these. 

Rewards is the harder thing to deal with, everything in gaming takes place at an accelerated pace and you can win battles and save worlds in a day. It takes some dealing with to realise it might take weeks to even get sort of good at something as menial as making pasta. But don't lose heart.",1

Think in terms of a personal ""board of directors"".  Identify the ""spheres"" of your life (i.e. family/faith, profession (vs. ""work""), physical health, etc.) and find folks to hang out with in the various aspects of your life.  Your profession (join an active association and participate/volunteer).  Your family/faith (find folks to simply walk alongside you - people your own age/life stage can be very helpful for simply validating what your are feeling/experiencing.

Thanks in advance.
I struggled with this for so long. 
This is the best advice I can give you;
Just WRITE. Don't filter, don't correct spelling, write EVERYthing down. If your mind starts to wander, keep writing, put it in, I know it sounds ridiculous but just trust me. When you get to the end, or a good stopping point, WALK AWAY. 
DON'T look at it straight away, go take a walk, have a glass of water, do push-ups. 
DON'T get on Reddit, 4chan, Facebook, etc. 
Walk away from your computer completely.

"How to stop my neighbor from using his motorcycle to save a parking spot? I live in a high density area with limited street parking. My asshole neighbor always uses his motorcycle to save himself a spot for his car.  It pisses me off to come home at night to find nowhere to park, and his bike blocking a parking spot that a car could go in.  Then as I'm circling looking for spots, he will come home, move his bike a few feet, and park his car in that spot.  

Any ideas? Would love to try to get him ticketed, but I don't think what he's doing violates any parking rules.
I love how OP avoids a logical response to the fact that his neighbor is actually being courteous in taking up one parking spot rather than two within an already limited parking area. OP, do you feel that because this neighbor will always have one vehicle remained parked where he lives, that he should park that vehicle somewhere unfavorable? and as a result force himself to never have a favorable parking spot since he parks both vehicles in the same spot?

If so, I think you should reconsider because if you were in his position, I'm sure you would do the same exact thing since it naturally just makes sense. It honestly just sounds like you are upset that your neighbor has an unfair advantage to parking over you, because of a byproduct of him owning a second mode of transportation.",0

"How do you stop telling yourself that you're not good enough for anything? Or how do I stop discouraging yourself? nan
It really comes down to a choice and taking action.


Your brain is tricking you into staying at home and not doing anything because its purpose is to keep you alive, not happy. Don't wait for your brain to kick into gear and get you out, it won't, you have to do it.


Do you know what a self fulfilling prophecy is? When you constantly tell yourself you're not good enough, several things happen. First, you condition that belief; in other words, you internalize it as a belief. Secondly, you will act in accordance with that belief. And lastly, your brain will be wired to constantly look for evidence to support that belief. All of this massively influences your choices and behavior, and your belief that you're not good enough will eventually lead to you live your life that way.


You have to make a choice to drop that belief. Replace it with how awesome you are, and take action as if you were. Thinking makes it so. Be realistic with where you're at, but believe that deep inside there's a part of you that's fucking awesome and then take action to grow that part of you-- get out of the house and keep doing what you need to do to get where you want to get. Failure is the only way to get better.  Wash, rinse, repeat for the rest of your life.",1

"how to get your dogs to stop barking endlessly at nothing Once it gets dark, my dogs decide that the best thing to do is bark at the void. How do I deter this?
A lot of times it's due to inactivity. Usually, not always, a well-exercised dog has no desire to bark. 

From the Humane Society's website: Make sure your dog is getting sufficient physical and mental exercise every day. A tired dog is a good dog and one who is less likely to bark from boredom or frustration. Depending on his breed, age, and health, your dog may require several long walks as well as a good game of chasing the ball and playing with some interactive toys.

Getting your dog outside also helps to socialize them. Finding a local dog park and taking them everyday is a great way for your dog to learn manners and get their energy out. I highly recommend a product called Whistle, which is basically a Fitbit for your dog. In my opinion, people don't get their dogs enough activity and then too many people wonder why their dog chews stuff around the house, or barks incessantly, both of which can be fixed by exercising your dog enough. I work a 40 hour week and still manage to get my dog 2 hours of activity each day.",1

Change your word processor to only mark misspellings and not to automatically change them.
If you mistype a word, immediately delete the entire word and type it again. This will more closely link the word and correct spelling than if you wait to the end and go through with the spell checker or even manually through looking for the marked misspellings.

"Removing the Smell of Smoke from a House I searched, and most of the tips I found were for cars and such, so hopefully you'll forgive me if this is a duplicate question...

I'm in the process of selling a home, and we had a number of showings this weekend, with a lot of feedback coming back that the house smells of smoke.  We haven't smoked in the house in months, and the carpet &amp; drapes have been cleaned, most of the furniture removed, etc.  

Any suggestions for more completely removing this smell, short of constantly spraying Febreeze &amp; whatnot?  Your help is appreciated.
You might have to paint.

Long-term smoking causes the smoke to seep into the drywall, making it impossible for the house to just ""air out"" on its own. They make paint that supposedly removes the smoke residue from the walls (I say supposedly because I've never seen it in action, so I can't personally vouch for it).

I've also noticed a general musty smell that can sometimes be mistaken for an old cigarette smell when I've been away from my house for a few days. In those times, the air is off and the fans are off, so the house starts to smell a little...stale, I guess is the right word. Constant air circulation may also help.",1

"How to explain/manage a late 40th birthday gift for my wife? I really wanted to get my wife something meaningful for her upcoming 40th birthday, and decided fairly early on that a piece of artwork would make the perfect gift. 

It didn't take me long to realise that buying art for someone else is a pretty nerve-wracking experience &amp; something that I have very little confidence in doing. Over several weeks of looking, I found many works that I liked, but wasn't at all sure that it was something she would feel the same way about. It's also a lot more money than we would usually spend on a gift for each other and not really something you can return, so I felt like I had to get it right.  

Finally, two weeks out from her birthday, I found a painting that I love and that I feel pretty confident she will too, so I've gone ahead and purchased it. What I didn't realise is how long it would take for the framing and delivery, which is 3-4 weeks...

Without giving away what the gift is, does anyone have any suggestions on the best way to explain this delay to her? Should I do it before her birthday? Should I give her something smaller on the day?

P.S. We are celebrating with friends &amp; family on the weekend a few days after her actual birthday, if that helps. As yet, we haven't made any plans for her actual birthday, which falls on a working weekday. Having a 2 year old daughter (who needs to eat fairly early &amp; be in bed by 8) also limits our options on the actual day.

Thanks in advance!
I say tell her ahead of time that it is delayed.  You don't have to tell her what it is.  Unless she is visibly upset.  Then you might have to tell her what it is.

But you don't want her to be disappointed on her birthday, and definitely not in front of her friends.

The 40th is a tough birthday.  Make as few surprises as possible.  Also be ready for her to get mad at you.  It won't have anything to do with the gift, it would most likely have something to do with the 40th.",1

You might need to get an eye exam to see if your vision is deteriorating.

I highly doubt it has anything to do with your use of one/two monitors, or your need to 'optimize your screen resolution,' what does that even mean? Your screen is optimized to use whatever resolution the LCD panel is made for, which is (most likely) what it's already set at.

Singing tricks time:

Posture is important. It'll make you look more confident and you'll have an easier time with the next step, so stand up straight. Don't arch your back though, just try to imagine a line from your ears to your shoulders to your hips and heels, and try to make it so everything's in the same line. For most natural positions, this posture is appropriate.

Next up, hold some tension in your abs. For an exercise, try to push all the air out of your lungs using your belly muscles. I think you'll find that you can sustain a longer, more even breath this way. Additionally, you will find that you have great projection because you have a constant pressure on your air.

Theres this secret quiet ‘confidence’ technique that I do. When you’re having or about to have a conversation with strangers or just people in general. Do this. 
1. Just listening to what they’re saying is great, do that, you don’t have to focus on what you’re going to reply or comment next when you just listen to what they’re saying, people who loves to talk likes to be listened to, and once you’re actually listening, you’ll be able to know what to reply to continue the conversation.
2. You can think and talk slowly, some say it even makes a person attractive but the main thing is, it gives you time to think, not stumble on words and seem like you’re just a relaxed person.
3. Even if anything embarrassing or you don’t like happens, it doesn’t matter, people are not thinking about you, they don’t care and thats kind of beautiful in a way.
4. Accept that you are what you are, not all people are built to go out and socialize, thats just what it is. (But of course if you choose to change who am I to say just stay there right?)",1

"Helpful and easy ways to lose weight/burn fat. .
There are only three ways to lose weight and burn fat. 1. Eat fewer calories. 2. Burn more calories. 3. Do both. That's it. There's no easy way. Any fad diet or exercise regime is one of those three. 

BUT the easiest way is to change what you eat. Whole grains, home-cooked, leaner meats, more fruits and vegetables. Cut out sugar. 

Doing that allows you to eat the same amount but with fewer calories and more nutrients. 

Add in a little exercise such as walking, a light sport, yoga, and you're golden. 

Other than that, it's a numbers game. A pound of fat has about 3500 calories in it. You simply have to burn off that many to lose it. Consider that a 240 calories in it, you could lose a pound or two over a few months just by drinking water instead.",1

And if you think it through you find you never could take enough data into consideration, the data for a decision in any given situation is infinite. So what you do is you go through the motions of thinking about out what you will do about this, but worriers are people who think of all the variables beyond their control, and what might happen!...Choice is the act of hesitation that we make before making a decision, it is a mental wobbling, and so we are always in a dither of doubt as to whether we are behaving the right way, doing the right thing, and so on and so forth, and lack a certain kind of self confidence. And if you see you lack self confidence, you will make mistakes through sheer fumbling. If you do have self confidence you may get carried away doing the entirely the wrong thing. You have to regard yourself as a cloud, in the flesh, because you see clouds never makes mistakes. Did you ever see a cloud that was misshapen? Did you ever see a badly designed wave? Heh, no they always do the right thing! But if will treat yourself for awhile as a cloud, a wave, and realize that you can't make a mistake, whatever you do. Because even if you do something that seems to be totally disastrous, it all come out in the wash somehow or other.

"Everyday Speech, finding the right words Even having regular conversations with my friends, I struggle to be able to find the right word quite often, do any of you have a trick or anything that helps with this problem?
Ditto on the reading tip. It expands your vocabulary and more importantly conversation topics. 

My first suggestion would be books, doesn't matter if it's fiction or non fiction as long as it's interesting to you. Find a book according to your age or maybe a little older. Look for a challenge. Don't shy away or skip weird words, take the time to investigate their meaning. You'll often be surprised to find out they mean something you're familiar with. 

If you don't have the time or disposition to read books, I would suggest perhaps cracked.com (my go to lunch break site). It has articles in a variety of topics and often speak in layman's terms.

If the accident is not your fault, this will make it much harder for the other driver to try to shift the blame onto you and claim you were partially at fault to try getting some money out of you.

What I do, currently, is walk to the nearest sink in my office, run my hands under cool water, and hold them up to a fan near my desk before going back to work.  That would be ok, but I'm already a bit ADD and have enough distractions, as it is.

She says she's not ready to get back together because she needs to work on herself. I asked how long it will be and she said ""Months and months and months"". I need to move on, but how?
Firstly: you need closure. If you truly want to break up, then you need to definitively say to yourself, ""I will not get back with this girl even if she wants me back"". Saying that she needs to improve herself for ""months and months"" is basically like saying you guys are going to get back together in a few months, which is not right if it's a true breakup. 

Until you achieve closure, then and only then can you start moving on with the rest of your life.

After that stage, then: whilst its different for everyone, universally the most effective way is to cut everything that reminds you of her out of her life, don't talk to her, and do things that make you feel better like exercise or doing something new.

"How to talk to adults comfortably. First off I'm a teenager and I'm deathly afraid of talking to adults. I thing it is a combination of not sure what to talk about, but I also feel like they are always judging me. Whenever I talk one on one I don't know where to look. Whenever I look in their eyes I feel weird but when I look away it seems like I don't care about what they are saying. I also don't know how to sit/stand. I know people say to copy their posture but to me it seems like I'm mocking them. Maybe all of this is in my head but I'm never sure. Any help i can get would be great.
I'm 43 and I still feel that way when I talk to anyone. So it's not really that big a deal.

I'll be honest when I am talking to a teenager mostly I think about how I felt when I was their age. So I'm pretty sympathetic. 

Just try to stand up, keep your head up, look people in the eyes but don't stare. Maybe like look for three seconds, then look away for a second or two, then look back again. Crossing your arms sends negative signals (boredom or closing-off) so try to avoid that. I like to carry a pen with me that I can fidget with because I am awkward at talking to people and it helps me not worry about what my hands are doing. Anything you can play with without looking at it... your phone is probably a bad idea.  

I'd say the most common thing I run into with teenagers is they never say enough. They're all two or three word answers and I have to pry information out of them. So don't be afraid to elaborate. Talking too much is a problem but it's much better than being mopey and silent.

"how not to get discouraged when job hunting. nan
Set a goal of number of applications in a day. You will have to come up with that number yourself based on the type of job you are looking for and your location.

For example if you are looking for an entry level fi ce job in a city with a lot of that type of work, you can set a high daily goal. Maybe 15 a day. It should only take you 10 min to an hour TOPS to customize and get a new cover letter and fill out all the BS on their web site. A lot of it will start to repeat itself anyway so you will be able to crank more out the more you send out.

If you finish 15? Take the rest of the day off and be at peace with it. Don't even work on it on weekends.....just finish up the ones you didn't finish on those days. If you do this 20 days in one month you will have THREE HUNDRED CV's out there. After readjustments, go for month 2. Remember to follow up on CV's sent out until they say no thank you or are clearly ignoring you.

You WILL get a call. If you don't, there is something fundamentally wrong with either your CV or your job expectations so you should get a second opinion. Try to find someone in the field to give you advice, job center, recruiters, etc....

If you are looking for something more specialized and/or in a smaller market, you will need to take that number down a lot. Some days you will only get one good application in.

"Accidentally broke TV in hotel room... I just moved across the country for a new job and am pretty much going to be broke until I get my first paycheck in a couple of weeks. Last night, perhaps the **dumbest** thing that has ever happened to me happened.. I haven't made any friends here yet (third day here), so I've been aimlessly killing time in my hotel room. I came across a superball as a prize in an arcade, and haven't seen those in probably 10+ years so I had to have it. Well, I made the grossly unintelligent decision of bouncing it in my room, and the first fucking bounce it took went off of a wall and hit square in the middle of the 40"" flatscreen (or plasma?) in my room. 

It wasn't on and I haven't even turned it on yet, but my fears came true as I turned it on and the LCD is completely fucked. When it's turned off you can't tell in any way that the TV is screwed up. 

I'm checking out on Sunday, and I looked up the value of the TV and it's roughly $500 somehow.. 

Is this something the maids would check when cleaning and readying the room for the next people? I imagine one of two scenarios happen here:

1. The maid turns on the TV while cleaning to either make sure it's not damaged or for entertaining while (s)he cleans, sees it's fucked, and reports it, or 
2. The next people to use the room turn on the TV, see it's fucked, and report it to the hotel

In either scenario I assume I'll be blamed (and billed), so what is my best unethical course of action here?

When I was a teenager I was very active and had horribly sweaty and stinky feet.  I tried powders, sprays, changing socks, everything.  I found this home remedy book my mother had received from Reader's Digest I believe and in this book was a wonderful remedy that  really worked.

Soak your feet in regular tea for 10 to 20 minutes everyday for about two weeks.  The tannin in the tea soaks into your pores counteracting foot stench and excessive sweat.

I had used the larger tea bags from Lipton, filled up a basin with hot water, threw two tea bags in there then just soaked my feet in the basin as the tea steeped.  You don't need the water boiling or anything but it needs to be hot enough for the tea bags to steep.  

I would advise doing this in a bucket or something other than your bathtub.   The tea stains your tub.",1

"How to take advantage of a clearly mispriced car on a dealer's website I recently stumbled upon a car dealership that has a car on their website priced at about $100,000 too low ($12k versus an MSRP of above $110k). I've received in writing from the dealership that the price is the $12k amount. I'm wondering how I might hold them to the stated price before they realize they've messed up.

The dealership is about 4 hours away, so I don't have a way of casually stopping by and confirming in person. For location specific info, the dealership is located in New Jersey, USA.


**UPDATE:** The dealership responded in about 15 minutes and said that it had already ""sold"". Not sure if I believe that though. They made no mention of its abnormally low price.

Since there's no reason to not share the link now, here's the car I was looking at, as well as an archived link in case they remove the listing. It was a 2022 Mercedes Benz S-Class. It was fun to think about for a couple hours though!

So I park on the main road outside my girlfriend's house, and someone keeps repeatedly returning and keying mine and my partner's car and even at one point her dad's, and the police aren't doing anything about it. It's draining our money to keep getting it fixed.

"How to stop caring what others think of you? I easily get caught up in others peoples opinions of me, no matter how relevant they are in my life. It also discourages me from learning how to do certain things, or getting good at something, because I feel like there's no point in it if others don't know about it, although I might be getting this confused with lack of motivation. How can I stop thinking this way and do what I want, without caring what others think of it, or flat out caring if they know about it?
I think we should clarify.  Caring about what other people think of you is actually a good thing.  It effects what opportunities will come your way and your success in life to a large extent.  Letting it effect you more than what you think of yourself is when it becomes bad.  

I know myself best.  I reflect on my experiences, my successes and failures, etc.  No one knows my thoughts but me.  I decide who I am and how I act to the best of my ability.  Because of this I have a self-esteem that shouldn't be effected by others.

However, when I read what you say it seems that the problem is the people you're around.  You say you lack motivation to do things because ""what's the point if no one cares?"".  Whoever the people are around you that make you feel this way, you must overcome them.  You can either live a life of quiet desperation or you can say ""Fuck that. Fuck them. This is who I am and how I feel, and this is what I will to do"".  They will either support you, be indifferent, or be unsupportive.  Either way, you simply must make your stand that you will to do and are free to do what seems right for you.  I do things like make music, sing/rap, dance, workout.  For the most part, very few people care, but I do them because they are things I like doing and they are their own reward.

Answers to this question, as well as how to approach the teacher and ask them to round your grade, would be appreciated by students across this subreddit, especially with the end of semester coming up.
Don't give the prof the opportunity to ask ""why should I round you up"", you should have presented the reason when you initially asked for the grade boost. Otherwise you sound like you're begging. 

I think the best reasons usually have to do with scholarships or applications. For example, if you got 78% in a course, but explained to the prof that you'll be in the running for a scholarship if you had an 80% they might give it to you. Ideally the reason you'd give would be true, or at least realistic. In general, profs don't want you to be broke or get rejected from grad school/jobs/etc that you're applying to, so if they are under the impression that you worked hard in the course, but are just shy of the grade you need they're often willing to give you a small boost.",1

"Should I call the cops prior to confronting the thief that stole my bike? Had an $1500 E-bike stolen from me and saw it being sold on Facebook marketplace the next day.

My plan was to call the cops before getting there, tell them the situation and say that I’m planning on hurting this guy badly, and hopefully they roll up as I’m testing the bike or whatever. Now hurting him is not my true intention but if I say that to the police, I’m thinking they will actually dispatch someone out rather than putting me on the back burner since I know they don’t take stolen bike calls seriously. Would I get in trouble for making such threat over the phone to the police? Is there a better way to handle this and retrieve my bike without getting the cops involved and walking out of there unharmed?




Update in comments.
Just call the company who made the bike to get the serial number on it. Give the serial number to the cops and they’ll confirm and give you your bike back and ask if you want to press charges. It’s pretty simple, especially with stolen bikes.

My buddy had his bike stolen, found it chained up on someone else’s porch stairs. Called the cops and they confirmed the serial number that he got by calling customer support. One cop ran down the thief and tackled him then arrested him, the other cop got bolt cutters out of the trunk and cut the lock off. Took some pictures and my buddy left with his bike that day.

Eat spicy foods. The reaction to the spiciness will cause you to sweat, which alleviates your internal body temperature from being so high. If you have a sensitive stomach/colon/toilet, just get a fan, keep some ice packs on you to put on the back of your neck which can cool you down a lot faster than if it were on your head.",1
"How to plastic seal windows behind mini-blinds so that the blinds are still usable Plastic window shrink film is awesome and very effective during the winter but I don't like how it prevents the usage of the blinds that it seals in.

I found this guide, which would make the blinds usable, but it creates a small hole in the plastic and thus breaks the seal:  http://www.familyhandyman.com/windows/how-to-operate-window-blinds-covered-with-shrink-film/view-all

Is there a way to apply window plastic **behind** miniblinds?
I don't think there is a cost-effective method that will maintain the thermal efficiency of the plastic film.

You would probably have to get replacement windows that are double-paned with the blinds inside. Probably pretty expensive.

OR

Remove the blinds and install them (or replacement blinds) that mount outside/above the window so you can plastic-seal with the window and the blinds would be completely external to the window and plastic film.",1

This applies if you live in the USA, I'm not sure about other countries.

"What to do when witnessing child abuse on the street (California, USA) My blood is boiling right now.  Walking by a bus stop, I saw a mother slap a boy not older than two.  Three times, for no apparent reason.  It was not hard enough to hurt, but given in such a casual and vicious manner that indicated the mother was in a habit of doing this.  The anger in the faces of both mother and boy were a miserable sight to watch.  I did nothing other than giving her a very dirty look when passing by.  I wanted to say ""you know this is going to come back at you later in life, right?""  I was the only one in the street at this moment and didn't want to start an altercation.  I feared it might be worse for the boy later on.  Also, I'm involved in a judicial process, and the last thing I can do now is get involved in a fight. 

I feel miserable I abandoned a defenseless person in a moment of need.  I would appreciate to know what to do in these cases.  Calling the police seems pointless if there are no marks left.  Calling CPS, too, since I don't know the person, and the incident happened at a bus stop.

"How to write a good paper I write a lot of papers for classes in college that are just 3 page wastes and they're hit or miss with grades. Sometimes I get a 100, sometimes I get an 80. A lot of the papers are ""3 point"" papers that are supposed to be planned like a 5 paragraph essay and then you talk a little more about each point so you're not counting paragraphs.

Is there any way I can do these papers quicker/easier/better? Some sort of organizational structure is what I'm looking for. Point 1 should be ""blah"", point 2 should be ""blah"", etc. And then how you would tie all that together. But in a productive way.

Thanks in advance.
The point of an essay is to explain your viewpoint and then back it up with facts. Most of the time you pick a topic that you agree with and therefore in your head you already agree. Try writing in such a way that a person holding the opposite view would read your paper and be swayed to your viewpoint. To clarify, start with your assertion, then use the 3 bodies to explain why and provide factual evidence and citation, conclude by saying for all these reasons, my assertion is correct. 

Maybe not the step by step you are going for, but it sometimes helps to step back from an issue and get a broader perspective. And if you are already getting 80-100% it seems like you get the idea. Most of the time the teacher doesn't care WHAT you are saying, as long as you demonstrate that you can back it up.",1

Don't have an answer for your question, but this is what I do for the homeless people in my area. I make care packages. I include: 
A poncho, dentist toothbrush/mouth wash minis, deodorant, wet wipes, chap stick, beef jerky, trail mix, anything tasty that will give energy and not be easily ruined in the heat, a bottle of water, sunscreen, clean socks... I get most of these by asking local dentist offices/grocery stores if they have extra samples and explaining what I'm doing. I've written to companies in the same way. The socks I usually buy in bulk. It's cheap. If it is a holiday, and I'm not completely broke myself, I try to also include a gift debit card with a couple bucks. I also will sometimes bring home cooked meals to them--saying, ""here, I made dinner and I had some left over and I thought of you"" has never incurred a bad response.

Remember most jobs want to know how you can handle the workload, stress, working with others. So mention group projects, if you played any sports etc. Hope this helps with future interviews! 
P.S. Never leave an interview feeling disappointed, they are all learning experiences that you get better at over time. And dont EVER turn down an interview, even if you know you won’t take the job, interview experience is very valuable! Good Luck!",1

"If I lose my health insurance, and need to go to the hospital, could I assume a fake identity and pretend that I misplaced my wallet so that I don't receive a bill? I could invent a made-up name, give them the homeless shelter as my ""home address,"" make up a new birthdate, and basically pretend to be a whole different person so that I don't receive a medical bill, could I?

Has anyone else attempted to pull that stunt? What happened? If they've been made, how was this bill-evading falsehood discovered?

I might end up losing my Medicaid from the start of next year if I'm ever found to make too much money this year. That's why I need to figure out a good way to replace my Medicaid that I can still somehow afford.

PS: I was born in the 80s but if I assume a birthdate of 1-1-2000 and explain away that I might look older than 22 because homelessness ages victims faster than when they live in a home, will that be a convincing explanation?
I work at an ER. A LOT of people do this. The key is to look like a poor person. And say you are homeless since (add 1-2 weeks) and that you have no identification because your wallet got stolen.

My question is, “Is there a standard/expected/efficient way to call 911 (or any emergency number)?”

I'm a former dispatcher (radio not call taker). I really wish there was a class in school or an internet resource for this. Expect questions. Probably a long series of them. The most important things to know is that as soon as the call taker knows what kind of emergency you have, they will send location, incident information and any other details so that EMS, fire or police will be on their way know what to expect. 

They will always ask about the presence of weapons. Please give a clear and definitive response to this. If you are not sure you could delay help arriving. 

Then they will ask more questions.  Listen closely and give clear answers. It might not seem important to you but they are asking for a reason.

I think a big part of finding the sort of people you'd like to be around is thinking about the kind of person *you* are and want to be.

Most colleges are large and have a lot of different sub groups that you can try out to see if you fit in.

Colleges have a lot of on-campus (and off campus) organizations like Student Activity Councils, Student Government, etc, which would be a good opportunity if you are that kind of guy/gal.

Campuses also have religious houses (on or off campus) which often have game nights, free food, etc, and do community service projects. Another good opportunity.

There are, of course, also Fraternities and Sororities if you feel inclined in that direction.

There are clubs, coffee houses, and a ton of activities. Go to the stuff that sounds interesting to you and you'll meet people with similar interests, which are the basis of any good friendship.

It's a little scary going to college, starting from scratch, but you'll do fine, promise.

The cliquish pressure of high school (or grades 9-12 in your case I'm assuming) are off. There's none of that inter-class struggle. People pretty much just hang out with and there's not really any of the bullying or bickering.

Here's some questions for you - how often do you deeply and significantly judge random strangers around you? How often do you even bother to think about them *at all*? How often do you ever see those random strangers more than once in a lifetime?

The answer to all of those ought to be something similar - that you don't pay them any mind at all; probably because you're too busy worrying about what they think of you to bother thinking anything of them. That right there is the trick, because most people function similarly to yourself. While you're busy worrying about what they think of you - they're busy worrying about what others think of them.

In addition to that you lack perspective, and that of course comes with time and experience - however it's always good to remind yourself that somewhere down the line you'll breathe your last and their opinions won't matter in the slightest, but what *will* matter is what you did. What *will* matter is the choices *you* made, the chances you *did* take.

"How to get rid of the fear that what you make isn't good or good enough I've been playing music for a few years now, and my final goal is to write my own music and songs. The most common advice I get is to 'just write songs, begin writing songs, no matter how shitty they are', but I just can't start because I instantly think 'this is not good enough' or 'this just doesn't sound good at all'.
I've run into the same problem many times writing. So I'll try to sum it up the way I learned everything. 

They tell you to just keep writing music, which you totally should. Sometimes you'll come up with lyrics first, sometimes you'll come up with the tune first. That doesn't matter. What matters is that you keep coming up with something. Songwriting can take years to perfect. 

One of biggest pieces of advice I can give you is to learn more about the musicians you look up to. Watching and reading interviews or documentaries will give you some insight in what they did and how they overcame their obstacles in writing. 

I've found songs that are years old, and it's always nice to go back and play some older tunes which you've completely forgotten that you wrote. And of course there will always be bad songs. Just remember to record yourself with whatever you can, and make sure you listen to it over and over. If you like it, show it to someone else.

"Loud birds early in the morning I live in an area with a lot of trees which attracts these extremely loud birds (Hadeda Ibis). Each morning (at around 5AM) these things don't just tweet and squawk - they literally shriek endlessly. The amount of decibels they push out is incredible.

"How to Stop Neighbors from Putting Their Junk Mail in our Mailbox This is going to sound weird and petty, but it's kind of bothering to me.

We've lived at our rental house for about a little less than a year, so we're new to the area. We keep to ourselves and don't know our neighbors very well, we're kind of out in the country, so homes are a little spaced, we're on about .5 acre. The mailboxes for our street are individual, yet all in a row and kind of grouped together. 

A few months back, someone starting putting their junk mail in our mailbox, mainly catalogues to retail stores: L.L. Bean, JcPenney, etc. The weird part is that they are ripping off the address that goes on the back of the catalogue so I cant see whos doing it. One time they accidentally left the account number intact to their L.L. Bean subscription, so I called L.L. Bean customer service to find out who it was, but they didn't tell me and I asked if they would just close that persons catalogue subscription because they obviously didn't want it and were putting their unwanted mail in my mailbox. They said they couldn't do that, which I kind of figured... its an odd request and an odd situation to begin with. I don't know how to stop it and since the person is deliberately ripping off the address and taking some of their trash with them, it seems like one of our neighbors has a problem with us, but I don't know why, we don't know anyone around here and have had no negative interactions with anyone.

Is there anything I can do to find out who's doing it? Should I just keep throwing away their junk mail and brush this all off? Its a very minor inconvenience.

"How to deal with loud and thoughtless apartment neighbors A bit of context: my across-the-hall neighbors are incredibly loud and irritating. The occupants are a single mom with five kids, and a sometimes-present boyfriend/father(?). While I honestly have no idea how hard it would be to raise all these children on your own, and do sympathize, the mother has made no attempts to keep the kids from being irritating little shits.

You can freeze bread, lunchmeat, cheese... just make sure you have plenty of freezer bags & squeeze all the air out before sealing. I recommend splitting it up into week portions & freezing right when you bring home to guarantee longest freshness after thawed.

What tips do you have for finding a decent apartment without seeing it in person?
- Lots of pictures that were taken with something other than a potato. Potato pictures usually mean they were taken years prior and won’t reflect the true condition. Better yet, see if the person/company listing it will take new photos or video for you.
- Watch out for phrases like ‘unique’ or anything very specific about neighbors and rules. 
- If available, read reviews about the place and/or landlord.
- If it’s too good to be true, it usually is. Three bedroom house for $700/month in an area where a 1 bedroom apartment is over $1000? It’s a scam.

"How to cope with losing your first pet. Hey all, I [21F] have just decided to put down my cat [Tinkerbell] after finding out she had cancer. She wasn't eating and she knew it was time to go, she was so calm and I was with her until she fell asleep for the last time. I feel like I did the right thing, but I still am having trouble dealing with the loss as this is my first time experiencing death of something I loved this much. Any tips on how to cope would be awesome! Thanks! #IMG_02 http://imgur.com/2YL6vr6
I can see that people are suggesting getting another pet.

But you need time to heal before you should do that. If you get another one now, all you will do is compare him with your lost pet. Its not a nice feeling, and may lead to resentment.

Heal, take some time, honor his memory, and then when you are ready to move on, think about getting another pet.

The way I see it, she was not a toy that broke and now you are to replace her. Give yourself some time, I know it sounds counter intuitive, but time is the great healer.",1

I just took a quick look at tsheets api and they do assign unique device ids, so if someone looks into it they can see if you use a different device then usual and when you used that device. 

That being said I don't know how much your supervisor would see as it doesn't mean it's implemented in their standard overview, just that it's being tracked.

A better option would be to fake your gps location on your device. But I guess your primary phone is an iPhone which would make that impossible without a jailbreak.

"Has anyone booked two shorter car rentals for the same time span of one long rental and saved money? (Details inside) I am looking to rent a car for a trip to Los Angeles.  I need the car Friday-Wednesday. First, I priced one rental for the entire trip ($319).  I then priced a rental from Friday-Sun ($62) and a separate rental from Sun-Wed ($125), which is significantly cheaper than the one long rental.  Is there a catch I'm missing?  This just seems too good to be true.  I suppose the catch might be the inconvenience of having to make a trip to the airport to return the first car but it seems like a small price to pay.
Parents own a location so i know quite a bit the only catch i see to this is having to return the car and get a new one and having to pay again for insurance and having to pay again to fill the gas tank before you return depending on the agency.

As rp_neo2000 says it is probably a weekend deal for the friday-sunday rental.

If it's on your floor, and hasn't been used or put away in a while, you probably don'e need it. Theres a time and place for building up your anal retentive neatness, but you have to start small, only own what you can clean, and build when you can handle it.

One method is to plan something way in advance. It may suck, but planning three months out usually means everyone can make it; very few other events are planned that far ahead except birthdays or vacations.

If a lot of your buddies have kids, schedule something kid-friendly. Better yet try to find something that is kid-friendly, but shifts to adults-only after a while. Street festivals are good for this as crowds tend to shift after kids' bedtimes. 

Sometimes having a drop by window, such as a BBQ at your place, can increase attendance. They just won't be all attending at the same time. 

Depending on your friends, having a definite start time can increase commitment and avoid the 'whenever' issue. 

Another benefit to planning far ahead is you can see clearly who will flake. Some people will agree to come, but then cancel when something better comes along. They are the 'nothing better to do than hang out with you' friends. In other words, not really friends at all.
