It's time. I was hoping to make it to my 21st but it's time. I'm kind of scared but it'll be better for everyone. I told my closest friends that I love them and I'll write a letter for my boyfriend and parents. My sister doesn't care about me. It'll be better for everyone.",1

I kinda want to see what her opinion of the insurrection was cuz than I’ll know weather I hate or not, if she disapproves of that than we all relatively good, I mean she’s still xenophobic. Also I actually kinda know things now and I could point out that it could take 60 years to get a fucking green card",0

"I'm confused.I need to put some thoughts into writing, as I'm sitting on the floor in the corner of my bedroom. I've finally put my keys down, so I'm not cutting into my forearms anymore.

I'm 26 now. My first suicide attempt was at 17. Ever since my failed attempt, I saw a new outlook on life. I started taking care of myself, I started working out, I pursued an education, I met people, I did things I enjoyed, and slowly those dark thoughts faded away.

After leaving university I now have a stable job and I'm doing very well financially. I've thankfully been able to maintain my job during the pandemic.

I have no struggles other than the fact that I'm extremely lonely. I feel like a selfish asshole for feeling this way.

I sent a few messages to family members and old friends to maybe talk and forget about things for a while, but I got no response from anyone. Understandable, it's a Sunday. The world doesn't revolve around me.

I've gone through psychiatric treatment, I've been on pills for two years up to the point my doctor and I both agreed I was good to stop.

I should get to the point. I'm considering suicide again, even though I've improved myself, even though I did things I always dreamed of doing, even though I've found friendship, and love, and financial stability. Despite everything, here I am, still wanting to die. I hate myself even more for this. I feel like a complete fucking asshole for having a somewhat normal life and STILL, after everything, wanting to commit suicide.

Is this normal? After all the progress I've made, I still find myself wanting to die.

Today more than ever. 

Apologies for the long post. Writing things down helps sometimes.",1

He's atheist, gay, lives in the kind of town that isn't very accepting, and he needs someone more qualified than I to talk to. This is not going very well so far. Any help would be appreciated.

"My grandparents threw away MY metal detector So I had the thing for years, I'm pretty sure I bought it at a thrift store. Well, my mom probably bought it for me, but still. It was mine and I was the only one who used it. Years ago I put it in the garage and haven't really used it again because there really isn't anywhere around me to use it. Well my aunt mentioned needing one the other day and I was like ""cool, you can borrow mine. Just let me see what stuff you find in your yard though."" 

So today I go looking in the garage and my grandma comes in and she's like ""are you looking for something?""

Me: ""Yeah. *My* metal detector. That I had in the garage. I haven't seen it for a while.""

Her: ""Oh yeah, your grandpa said that was a piece of junk. He probably threw it away.""

Me: ""But it was *mine*! I bought it. And it worked fine when I out it in here.""

Her: *laughs* ""No, I'm pretty sure your mom bought that for you. Me and your grandpa were thinking of buying a more expensive one for us.""

Me: ""Still, that was mine! Can you buy me a new one?""

Her: ""Why would I do that?!""

Like.... what?! I don't throw away your shit and not tell you! I have never thrown away anything they own! They've never shown any interest in wanting to get one or even using the one I had, but all of a sudden they want a more ""high-end"" one after throwing *mine* away!",0

"Live to suffer. Can’t dieYou know I can say with 100% certainty when my life ended and that started with my school, I went to a charter school from middle school- high school that destroyed my all dreams (name calling saying you’d never make it etc... and redirection to STEM) with added anal from my mom to prepare you for college and enter the job force only now I never feel happy even with therapy I can’t enjoy the things I used to love anymore. I have ptsd when I try to do them.

Idk what to do with my life now and I’m in college doing exactly what I spent 13 years having drilled in my head to do.... chronic depression is a bitch and I don’t remember ever waking up thinking today’s a great day to be alive. I don’t even know why I’m in college.  

I just feel dejected I don’t want to do anything but be a kid again but I can’t I have to remind myself I’m 20 everyday because I stopped counting after 14. Hard to go to therapy again and have goals when you don’t see yourself alive 1 week from now, so I’m just on the  internet reflecting on my life and what I could have done and what’s wrong with me.

The road of hell are paved with good intentions  in this case suffering which is all mine.

Anyways college starts soon and I needed to get that off my head before I start again with the mindless learning for a degree I could give 2 shits about. 

 I’ve been suicidal my whole life I doubt that’s going to change fear of death is a roadblock I’m trying to get around for 12 years. I guess I’ve realized that life is sadistic and I’m just going to keep existing in a world I don’t belong in anymore essentially suffering forever in this life).

"VENTING // TW: Self Harm // 03.07.2019I have this massive urge to tear up my arms really badly. I want to bleed out. I want my arms to be destroyed. And to laugh while people try to hold the skin together - but they can’t.  So I just bleed out and die. But I’ll be happy as it happens. 

Content. Finally.

I’d feel proud that I could do that much damage to myself. And relieved that I finally get to die. I think I’d be smiling as I bled. And laughing. I’d feel so happy. 

I want the rush of seeing so much blood. And my insides. A reminder that I am nothing. Just a fleshy capsule kept going by a heartbeat and oxygen. Nothing more. 

Everything else we think we are is an illusion. We’re not special. Or unique. Or anymore worthy of life than any other living organism on this earth. We are a blip in the timeline of existence. We are absolutely nothing. Irrelevant. Useless. Unnecessary. 

And all it takes is a nick to an artery to end it. And that’s it forever. We are so fragile. 

I wish I had the physical strength to reach my radial. 

I’d finally be happy.

"Thoughts of ending it give me comfort?So as a new year's resolution I came up with a decision to kill myself on my next birthday, which is in december, if I keep feeling like shit because nothing helps. And what do you know, everything is much brighter, I'm happier than ever, just because that thought gives me so much comfort I guess? 

Yesterday I did some thinking and realized there's no way this is healthy (like no shit). I could keep faking it but I feel like that will only send me deeper than I was before. This is the first time in 4 years I'm seriously considering ending it. My life is not that bad, I'm actually trying very hard to be active and do lots of stuff but all of it feels like it's for nothing. I used to feel like shit when I was broke, now that I am earning something I see that money really can't buy happiness.

I’m not choosing to live but I’m afraid of dyingI don’t want to keep living. Life is just upsetting and is a perpetual source of upsetting events and reasons to die. But every time I look for ways to die I’m instead met by ways that attempted suicide will end up with me having long term disabilities or brain damage. So my options are to live a life that makes me want to die or to risk taking away my ability to do anything about it and increasing my overall suffering with no benefit. I just want to be happy but it isn’t happening and it looks like it never will. I don’t know what to do.,1
"I might try it againI have felt suicidal for as long as I can remember and a few months ago I actually swallowed all my pills in the middle of an argument with my mom.

Until a few weeks ago.

Just some friendly (hopefully helpful) advice (coming from personal experience If you’re ever doing something or think of doing something and the immediate thought after said thing is “damn I’m gonna regret doing that.” Please don’t do it! Remove that thought out of your head completely. Sorry if this sounds harsh but things are mostly gonna go wrong for you  and it’s gonna suck way worse than before (and probably cause pain).

"My one mantra to keep me from actually doing it used to be « you will send your mother to the mental asylum ». After another 2-hour rent of gaslighting and insults, my consideration has vanished.I am in a codependent relationship with my mother. I have been realizing how badly it affects my life, my ability to socialize and work correctly. I can’t talk to her about it because she breaks down if I try to bring issues to her attention. 

I got laid off because of covid after working myself to exhaustion for a toxic boss. My self confidence is crushed, I am burnt out.

When I heard my colleagues talk, it hit me how much self respect and self confidence they had. And I realized how bad my situation was, how detrimental it is to my relationships with others, my ability to work, to function.

I am tired of failing at life. Even if I had a child, how could I raise them correctly and securely, when I doubt myself so much???

Every time I see someone kill themselves I get more and more frustrated. I've beat this demon.  I know you can too. Keep being awesome and keep up the good work of keeping this demon locked up.

"I feel absolutely despised by the world..Alright reddit, I made this account to hide my identity, but I really need you guy's help.

I am a scientist in real life, but I'm an autodidact so I don't make much money.

Things got weird when his mom quit her $18 an hour job because she ""Got tired of working and it's the MANS job to support the family"". I had 2 choices, me and my partner go homeless or support an old bitch. Eventually it got out of hand, so me and my SO moved back to North Carolina to stay with my parents a while. 

I have severe Bipolar disorder and OCD, so sometimes I tend to act a bit unusual. This hasn't gone un-noticed by my coworkers and family. Every 5 seconds someone is upset at me for SOMETHING, whether its small stuff or big. No one speaks to me at all unless it's for a negative reason. My SO seems to have no sexual interest in me whatsoever anymore, I constantly get made fun of for not going to college (idk WHY but..) 

I dunno...I feel like I'm just bitching to you guys, and that this isn't really a serious matter and I should just accept the fact no one wants to be my friend, but in the long run, yes, I have considered suicide. I feel like if I did go through with it, the only people who would really notice are the ones I live with.

I hate my family. Mostly just immediate: Mom, Dad &amp; Brother. You can tell my parents just put up with me, and my brother hates me. I guess it just sucks that the people you'd think are kind of forced to like you just don't, and you don't understand why.

Then there's my husbands family. I feel constantly judge by them, even though they're no better. I hate them. They hate me too, but I guess they've learned to put up with me for my husbands sake.

Then there's me, the person I hate most of all. I'm a bitch and very aware, yet I seem to be unable to control it. I hurt my husband daily. Sometimes I notice, other days he suffers in silence. We've been intimate a handful of times since our daughter was born - 3 months ago. And it's not like we're an older couple - 20 &amp; 22.

I can't be touched, held. So there's no cuddling. I hate kissing some days, and the thought of sex is very draining. 

I hate myself. I don't want to be me anymore. I hate my life. The same routine, and even days that get new surroundings I can't remember the details.

I miss my husband when he's gone, but want him gone when he's here.

I'm a horrible human being. I know I should be killed off.

I cry daily. I think about dying daily. Some hope to win the lottery, I hope to be murdered walking down the street.

I'm so depressed. I hate myself.",1

"My poop is weird today i pooped, and i realized the poop was weird  
my mom asked me why is my poop like that  
and i answered  
my poop has always been like that  


I have pooped like this my entire life  
One day i was pooping out on the street  
and some stranger came up to me, he looked like he was 70 and said ""nice poop""  
and i was like ""thanks old man, you too""   


And there i was pooping weirdly, and i realized, i do poop pretty weird  
i realized the poop wasn't poop  
it was actually poop

Its because.... because.... YOU'll KNOW \*Kills Myself\*",0
I'm tired of livingCan I please get some help. I am a 17 year old guy. I am diagnosed with OCD. I think I have depression too but I don't know. I'm tired of everything.

"I have 1 month as of todayDecided as of today I am going to give myself one month to live, and either God can kill me in that time or I will do it myself. I don't know what portion of my thoughts are coherent and I know I need help but history has repeated it so many times, I'm convinced that I have no purpose in the world except to cause harm to those around me, but I'm selfish so I try to create friendships, etc whenever I can and then fuck them up. Pretty sure some kind of divine intervention has it in for me at the moment (which I completely deserve), so if the universe doesn't get rid of me by the 8th of March I'm doing it myself.

I don't want anybody around me to know but I still want to talk about it somewhere, but I feel as though I'm not doing it for anybody's sympathy. Or maybe I am, cause as has been established I am a naturally selfish and evil person who manipulates people into feeling bad for me. But everyone talks about this stuff on here so I just want to get it out. 

Perhaps instead the universe will give me some sort of sign I should keep living but I doubt it. If I am going to be the toxic person in so many people's lives I don't deserve to be here anymore.",1
"sometimes I wonder if killing myself is the only way I can find peaceI'm 17 years old, I'm working a job I hate, and my anxiety about this pandemic has gotten me spiraling out of control 

I think I'm poisoning myself with what I'm doing to keep myself from getting sick. I cant drink out of cans or bottles and I cant even eat sweets or chips without spraying it with lysol or using disinfecting wipes on them. I'm so scared of getting sick its unreal. I think I'm subsequently making myself sick in the process. my dads trying to get me to go on medication, but I dont think itll help. 

I know I'm more lucky than others, i have a boyfriend that loves me and a family that tries to help but everytime i start to spiral it feels like they cant help me. hell, I tried to vent to my mom on the phone and she just started to cry saying she cant help me and to just give up if I'm not gonna accept her ""help"". I'm in my last year of school doing it all online and I cant do anything. I'm in lower classes bc my act score was shit, and everyone around me just makes me feel like a failure in comparison. 

I don't know why I'm posting this, maybe I just want attention? idk. but I'm tired of waking up everyday at 2pm getting ready to go to a job that makes me feel miserable. the only thing that's given me any joy is engaging in any kind of sexual act(s) with my bf. I feel like a piece of shit. I feel sick. I just want this all to be over. 

I thought moving to my dads house would make everything better, but it didnt. everything feels the same way. it just makes me think maybe the only way I'll ever truly find peace is when I go to heaven, if I'm even able to go with all the sinful things I've done to make myself feel any kind of emotion. 

I feel bad for even posting this bc I know I'm more well off than others, but I'm truly just sick of living the way I do. it feels like theres no way out.",1

I'm still alive, I'm not sure how I feel.I went down the beach last night for several hours in the wind and rain, took a hip flask full of rum, got drunk and cut myself, not overly deep, just a lot of times, but it felt relaxing watching blood flow down my arm in the rain. Just standing shallowly in the waves felt really relaxing too. I was hoping it would just carry me away. I couldn't there though as people came along to nightfish.

I got home in the early hours feeling as if I was going to pass out as I'd lost quite a lot of blood at this point. Completely stained one of my only white tshirts. I did the arm above head thing that someone told me on Reddit last week to stop the bleeding. I sat there on my bed just feeling numb for about an hour. Then I drank some more and took a handful of xanax, hoping it would kill me. I sat there for about 15 minutes listening to 'Only' by Anthrax. Suddenly I threw up. I guess my stomach couldn't handle all the pills and alchohol. I don't know how I feel. I was really hoping that everything would just end last night. I still feel shit about everything.",1

Okay, first off, I barely qualify as a teenager. I'm 13 turning 14 in a couple months, so I'm at the beginning of the ""cringe era"".

Also, when I got a girlfriend I told everyone. They semi-congratulated me, but I failed to tell them we broke up. I got a new one who actually cares about me as a person and helps me out. However, I was once going to talk to my friends and they were at another friend of mine's house. I asked why I was invited, and I SHIT YOU NOT, THEY SAID THIS.

"These chronic migraines are killing me. It’s been since 2012, and I’ve only had a break for 3 straight weeks after a $2500 week-long ketamine IV. It’s too much. The 20th is the anniversary of my best friend’s suicide. And my Dad’s attempted suicide. I feel it’s meant to be.Seriously, each night there comes a time that I ponder death.  It’s only my loved ones holding me back - and yet I can’t help but wonder if they are wrong, and I’d be freeing them and this could be he most selfless thing to do.  That I’m selfish for sticking around for life’s few pleasures when my family would do so much better without me, lying in bed.  Doing nothing because of the pain.

I truly doubt whether they’d miss me.  My doctor just now wouldn’t give me enough painkillers and I made a fool of myself, blubbering in my office.  He asked if I’ve tried anti-depressants.  Of course I have!! I was diagnosed with borderline, and drugs rarely work on us.  I’m a trauma child, and though I kicked borderline (minor miracle), it’s been hell.  My best friend died from Borderline.  She hung her self when she got her shoelaces back.

I couldn't believe I stuck with life. I am so happy. Happy for being here. Happy for the strength to endure the pain. Happy for the support Ive received.

I am more privileged than a 5'0"" woman because my body is more dainty and petite, but I want to look ugly and manly and gross so I don't feel as guilty.

I am guilty and I wish I was either a 5'9"" man or a 5'7"" woman so I could feel ACTUAL oppression.  Being more than 7' as a man or less than 4'9"" as a woman is the definition of privilege and patriarchal beauty standards and I feel like I am taking society backwards by meeting the biggest beauty standard.  Honestly being deformed and less than 4'9"" as a woman is considered more privileged than being beautiful and 5'4"" and I feel guilty for taking society backwards by being a privileged height.

I live in the UK by the way, where the beauty standard is apparently to be 4'8"" according to everyone I meet.",1

"Sick of constantly wanting to dieI mean, like most people on this forum, I want to die. Constantly. Even when I am happy I want to die. I am just sick of always feeling tired and not feeling like my life is mine. I work three jobs and am taking part in graduate school. I have a best friend, whom I love very very much, but constantly feel like I have to emotionally babysit. I have a boyfriend whom I love but honestly can't feel comfortable with; my fear of him abandoning me makes it hard for me to relax and enjoy our relationship. I have lost two best friends whom I can't seem to get over or forget. My father, the only supportive parent in my life, has cancer. My mother is a complete c*nt and manages to make me feel guilty for existing despite me knowing full well our damaged relationship isn't my fault. I fear all of my friends really hate me and are putting up with me. I feel like school just isn't worth it. I'm so busy I don't have time to go see a doctor, or therapist, or go to the gym (exercise makes people feel better sometimes). Despite having 3 jobs I have money problems. Almost zero me time. 

I want to die. But I'm scared of dying painfully. I want to die peacefully. I hate waking up. I don't want to feel this way. ",1

I did it in the worst way and I knew she didn’t like me or hardly even girls. She was the first person in a while I was close with, she never made me feel bad about my flaws and I was so comfortable with her. She was so kind to me. We hung out all the time and I know I made a mistake- I apologized and all about anything that could’ve made her feel bad but she just ignored me. She ignored me while I was crying right in front of her and yeah it makes me kind of mad that she said it didn’t matter and that she wouldn’t hurt me and then did that. She showed no emotion and didn’t even respond just texted a friend. But I still miss her. I miss her so much. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to lose this person but it feels like I already have. I was getting over her and just wanted to be friends and blew it. Everything reminds me of when we were together and I can’t get over it. I just want to somehow fix things and I can’t move on. She lives right next door too- I just I feel like I ruined something that could’ve been great and god I hate it. It can’t be fair why does one mistake make something disappear just like that??? Why can’t I go back or anything? I don’t know if I should talk to her again but I feel like it’s really over. I don’t wanna be a pest or bother her. I dont want to be weird.

"Let me tell you some cool dinosaur facts * Tyrannosaurus rex lived closer in time to modern humans than it did to Stegosaurus.
* Spinosaurus probably had an M-shaped fin, a paddle-like tail and spent most of its time in water.
* The first dinosaur to be formally named was Megalosaurus.
* Sinosauropteryx, a small theropod, was the first dinosaur to have colouration determined. It had reddish feathers and a banded tail.
* Yi qi was likely capable of gliding like a flying squirrel. It also has the shortest possible scientific name of any organism.
* The smartest known dinosaur was probably Troodon

Yeah. Cringe thumbnails. If I have to see one more circle indicating pregnancy or boobs on a minecraft ""mob"" that's a player in a vaguely green female skin I will commit a war crime.

"It's my 22nd birthday and that's 22 too much for me**+++ For the record, I'm not following any of the shit ideas my head has. At least don't intend to. +++**

All my life I've been abandoned, neglected and traumatized, got around 50 traumata. I am alone, I have no family as they are totally shitty. My ""friends"" also abandoned me, I'm just not good enough or too annoying.

One of the first things I did around midnight (almost 1am now) is posting a depressing meme to reddit which I prepared an hour before. Whilst crying. I am sitting alone in my room and nobody is here. I feel dead inside and at the same time like I'm about to explode.

My head is constantly having thoughts like ""What could we do today? What about overdosing on painkillers or so?"" or before when I was in a subway thinking that I should better be below it and that's really annoying. Also I know that it's not the best way anyway and I wouldn't want to involve others in such a thing. That'd be awful. It is my 22nd birthday and I feel like I should ask for an apology that I wasn't aborted. Everyone resents me in the end and there's nothing I can do about it.

My whole family is hateful and especially towards me, my mother which whom I also cut contact by now confirmed that my father would likely be glad if I committed suicide. I just wanna vanish. I can't because I lost someone to suicide and this feeling - I just can't make the ones I love feel like that. As much as I want to cease to exist.

I. Hate. Everything.

I don't know what to do and I don't know why I am even writing this when I don't actually intend to do anything? Whatever. In a month I am 2 years selfharm-free (used to cut myself heavily) and even that doesn't cause any emotions but missing having a way to cope. Eating disorder flaring up so I get at least a fake sense of control. Maybe I die from this, then nobody loses me to suicide, chance is 15%. But maybe another of my diseases gets me first.

I have chronic pain and it's awful. I just want to stop that. I want it to end. It hurts. My body as well as my mind. I can't handle it.",1

I’d really like it if they didnt kill themself, theyre one of my best friends, and it hurts so fucking much to think about life without them, but it feels so selfish to ask them not to. shit sucks for them all the time, and im pretty sure it’d just make them feel worse to stick around.

"I'm a coward who has squandered my chancesI'm a coward. I've squandered the chances I've been given because I'm too fearful to put in the work and put myself out there. The position i'm in now is almost entirely my own fault. I should be so much further in my career and in my relationships than I am. I'm just so afraid of rejection and failure. Rejection bothers me much more than it does the average person. So i've lived my life as safely and with the least risk possible. And that  is how I ended up here.

Even after realizing that I shot myself in the foot, I'm still too scared to keep pushing on and put myself out there. This is what kills me. I've realized that i'm a coward, that I need to move forward, but i'm just so scared all the time that I can't bring myself to do anything. My cowardice bothers me to no end. I see opportunities everyday to improve my life. I see them and acknowledge that they're there, but then I let them slip by. I'm left feeling furious at myself and my cowardice.

I deserve what I've made my life into. I don't think i'll ever be brave enough to change. And every lost opportunity haunts me. I remember the times I was brave and wonderful things happened in my life, but I don't think I can ever get back to the person I was then. Each time I run away from opportunity, I feel like I lose a little bit of my soul. 

I feel condemned, by my own doing and weakness, to live the rest of my life out the way I have been doing for so long. Rather than suffer by my own devices, I am beginning to think that suicide is the better option. I've lived for years like this, suffering quietly but doing nothing about it. If I can't change how I live my life, I can at least choose to die and be free of all of this.",1

"Done with lifeNothing has ever gone well in my life, ever. For the 16 years I have been on this earth nothing has ever worked and never have I been truly happy. From girls who don't even want to be my friend, to finding out that I'm only going to be 5'3 (I'm a guy) for the rest of my life, and people constantly harassing me online for no reason. I don't know what to do, nothing seems to improve my situation. I have tried remaining positive but its difficult to when everything you hope would turn out good doesn't. I've had suicidal thoughts in the past but this time I actually feel I might go through with it. I honestly don't know what to do, I feel the only way for me to end this suffering is to commit suicide but I don't have it in me to do that to my parents. I see my 16 years here on this planet as a small preview to how life is going to be for me and so far it doesn't look good and I don't want to live like that. I don't feel I have anything to live for; I only have a couple friends, no girlfriend, I am not athletic or academically gifted, there is no thing I am singularly good at, I'm unattractive and lonely. I don't feel that me living anymore would matter, as I am sure I will not be successful or contribute anything to society If I am older. Its difficult for me to contemplate but I feel suicide is a necessarily thing for me to do.

"Probably going to end it all after the visit.I'm 19 and I've been a pretty healthy guy my whole life, however, in the past year my life has gone from bad to worse. I have a sister who was also healthy at a young age, but 6 years ago she developed a weird chronic cough that wouldn't go away. She went to tons of doctors none of them knew what it could be until one day a doctor said she should be tested for ""Cystic Fibrosis"", I had no idea what it even was, no one in my family tree did. However, she got a cat scan, and a blood test. The cat scan showed multiple cysts in her lungs and kidney. The blood test came back positive for CF and now life is living hell after researching this horrible diesease I'm ready to kill myself. Now, if you think the worst part is over you are mistaken. about a year ago I started having issues in the morning constant throat clearing, minor coughing (not like my sister but still annoying). Feels like there is something in my throat and my mother also started having the same thing at the same time. Me and mother have been having this strange weird coughing/throat clearing sessions in the morning for the past year and doctor just told me it was minor swelling however I am a hypochondriac so now I've pretty much set myself death date. I cannot live with this horrible problem my mother should not even be HAVING any issue as she is 48 even the specialist said it would be impossible for my mother to have this diesease. Knowing that I could now have the same dieases my sister however, and knowing I could soon be having lung problems scares me to death. I'll be getting blood tested soon for the diease. After I get blood tested I'll probably just end it.

I need to escape my own consciousness. I’ve thought about it and these thoughts aren’t irrational. They are real. I’m self aware as ever and unwilling/unable to change.

"There is no point in being nice or caring.Everyone will hate you for it. 

It doesn't matter. This world will assume the worst about you no matter what. You try to be decent. You try to be caring. You try to be invested in your work. In your hobbies. In people.

You think you want to connect with people because you want to improve your ability to interact socially but the truth is, you're reaching out because you hope someone will grab your hand and save you from drowning in your own anxiety.

Drowning in your own black hole of depression.
Save you from yourself.

The truth is nobody cares. Words will spill out of your mouth like debris from the collapsed buildings of intent and everyone will assume you're only out to score or take advantage of someone.

People will ignore your actions. Your reputation. They'll only focus on something you said; not your history of anything you ever did, like standing up for the less fortunate or the marginalized.

"This is the only place I can talk about thisUsing a throwaway account because I need to get this off of my chest but I’m scared of speaking out fully as people I know irl know my reddit account. 


For the last five years I’ve been slowly growing more and more sad and upset with life due to my own stupid mistakes. 

I have a loving family and sure we don’t always get along but I love them all to pieces.

The stupid mistakes I made haunt me to this day, no one knows about them besides me and the people involved, and that kills me. I have so many passions I want to pursue, like my singing or my art however I’m terrified that if my face gets out there one day I’ll wake up to hear everyone I love knows what I did. 

I was so so fucking stupid and if I could go back I would have stopped myself. It was only five years ago I found out what I did shouldn’t have happened, that I should have never done it and since then it’s been creeping up on me and eating away at me. 

I can’t tell anyone about it who I care about and if I went to see a doctor and looked for help, I’d be scared someone would find out, I’m scared I’d break down, I’m scared I’d lose my place in college.

I’ve thought about killing myself so many times, I even tired not taking my crohns and colitis medication for a while, hoping this illness would kill me slowly, but kill me none the less, but my mother soon found the full pill boxes and injections. 

It feels like a huge weight is being dropped on my head. I wasn’t forced to do what I did, I was a stupid child who didn’t know what they were getting into or how bad what they were doing was. I was naive and now it’ll haunt me for the rest of my life, however long that’ll be anyways. 

Thank you for reading this strangers of Reddit.

"Today's my 20th birthday; two years ago I told myself that, if things hadn't gotten better by now, I'd commit suicide.And they haven't. If anything they've gotten consistently worse.


I can't even bring myself to cry anymore: the sadness forms, and I feel like crying, but I've done it so much these past few years it's like my body's run out of tears.


I went to therapy for a little while, about seven sessions or so, but stopped when I made my therapist cry two visits in a row. The other times, he's at a loss for words and says he can't figure out how to talk me off the ledge I currently stand on. Can you imagine that? I'm so fucked up that when I talk about stuff that's been with me since I was a little kid, I make mental health professionals cry and stammer. Am I really that far gone?


I've had the gun there for the longest. I don't know why I haven't done it yet. Why did I hang on for so long? Ignorance? Fear? Hope? Probably some combination of the three.

The only reason I live is because I fear death is worse. That seems like what would happen, give what's already happened to me. It always gets worse. No matter what. Hell, maybe I won't even get to die, but they'll pick the fragments of my skull off the floor and stitch me back together and I'll be forced to live out the rest of my life disfigured and locked inside a mental hospital. That sounds worse than death, honestly.

I don't even know why I typed this out. I might leave a link to this account in my suicide note so whoever bothers to bury me can read what I've wrote. At least nobody can say what I did came from out of the blue then.

Relationships are rollercoasters. I get paranoid. Lash out constantly. Look for evidence that they hate me and are just using me. Who the fuck would love me. 

Financial and emotional leech on parents.

Years of therapy. So many fucking medications. Three hospitalizations. Feeling normal for a few hours before lapsing doesn't seem worth how much time and effort and money it takes to get there. 

I think my brain is just broken. Maybe it could be fixed eventually, but why? I'll still die in the end. Why struggle so much just to delay the inevitable? Why keep hurting people? Why keep wasting resources? Why give people hope that I'll get better, just to dissappoint them again? Why not just make it final? Why not let them grieve and move on instead of this back and forth?

"I am feeling at peace.Many times in the past, ending my life on my own terms has been an idea born out of a spur of the moment, emotion-laden breakdown. However, I have felt a slow and steady build up of rationalized reality behind committing suicide. 

I remember a day when I would burst into tears after realizing I actually contemplated doing something so permanent and shameful. Now, thoughts about suicide (planning it, tying up loose ends, etc.) offer a respite from the deep emptiness and pain I do not want to battle with anymore. I am exhausted, I want my eternal sleep more and more each day. 

The last person I derived any pleasure in arguing with about my opinion on suicide is exhausted in their efforts. They are absent now, as I am once again looking temptedly into the void . I know I am impacting a part of their life negatively each time I need to talk about this and that is not a note to go out on. I love them deeply, and I do not want their memory of me to be painful and cause regret. 

I have written a good number of letters. I spent a very good day with members of my family I do not see often. I have plans for my things after I am gone and a detailed account of almost everything that plagues a family after a death. I have a few things left I want to do, and some people I want to tell goodbye in my own way. I have enough energy to be as normal as I can to the people in my life that love me for the remainder of my time. I hope my efforts will be enough that they will forgive me after I am gone. With their memories of me and time, I hope healing will come. This is the only unpleasant thing, knowing I'll hurt some people with my choice. 

I guess that is why I write in this thread. My explanation is long and may go unread, but if I could find someone who may understand, I could have hope that those who love me will one day understand that this is what I wanted and it is no one else's fault. Thank you.",1

"I kinda attempted suicide tonightI had a horrible day and I've felt really set on killing myself. I was driving on the highway and when I drive and I'm having a really bad day and really thinking about suicide I drive recklessly. Turn the headlights off when it's dark, close my eyes, don't wear a seatbelt, drive in the oncoming traffic lane, etc. I know it makes me a piece of shit, but I do it.



Anyway today I was on the highway driving and I wasn't wearing my seatbelt. I was feeling very very bad but had no choice but to be driving. I thought well this isn't my plan but it could be it, I sped up to 85+ in a 55 and slipped into the oncoming traffic lane.


I saw a car coming in the distance and after a few seconds survival instinct brought me back into my lane. They definitely saw but I'm sure didn't think I was thinking of purposely hitting them.



Again i know this makes me a shitty person and this tonight makes me feel even more likely to kill myself but using my actual plan rather than risking somebody else's life who doesn't wanna die.



That being said I wish it would've worked, that I could've hit a tree or something that wouldn't hurt another person.",1
"Everything HurtsI feel like I'm in too much emotional pain to go on anymore, like I just can't do this. I'm no good to anyone and will always fuck up everything. I really never had anything to live for and nothing I enjoy doing. I have no talents or skills or aptitude for anything. I'll never have a decent job and on the unlikely off chance I figure something out I'll just ruin it again like I did now.

 I'm just too stupid, pathetic and weak to suceed in the world. I can't deal with the guilt, shame and self-hatred of knowing I've ruined everything and will have to start at square one again. I also know I can't function around people well and probably don't deserve to have friends. I don't think I could stand bring myself in public.

 Everything just hurts too much now and I feel like I can't function and I just wish that I could give up. I hate having to look in the mirror each day and spending each spare second thinking about how much I hate myself.I wish I was dead but also know I am too much of a coward to do much about it and feel trapped.

I feel like my life is ruined and I don't know if I'll even be able to yank myself out of bed tomorrow. I know my life is never going to amount to anything regardless and I can no longer deal with the disappointment of others.",1
"I've lost it allIm just gonna list all my problems because I don't wanna make someone sit around all day reading

my neck is injured
my knee is injured
I'm addicted to drugs
my friends all hate me and left me
nobody wants to be friends with me because it's not cool
my mom is abusive
everyone thinks I'm autistic
people tell me to kill myself
my friends have let me almost drink bleach
my room is a mess
my grades were terrible and I'm surprised I wasn't held back
I'm a suicidal pussy
I don't love anymore
Im sick all the time
I can't feel normal
I can't get therapy
I can't afford the drugs I use to cope with my life
nobody in my grade/school knows I exist
they wouldn't care if I died
so I figure I may as well what have I got to gain from just being I'm going to end up insane and homeless I have a noose I made from some crappy items and It just feels kinda good to know if it gets too bad I can just do it.

"something broke in my brain this time- in the middle of a complete breakdownI was in a psych ward from 10/28-11/4 for almost attempting. Since I got out I've been completely non-functional, losing my shit, haven't had a day pass where I wasn't actively suicidal. I'm so ready to do it. I'm so tired. My psychiatrist says I'm having a mixed bipolar episode and she's right. I'm struggling severely with an eating disorder. Can't get out of bed. Can't leave my apartment. I hate everything about myself. Probably going to have to drop out of this semester of school (third time I've dropped out.) Not totally convinced that I'm not going to kill myself tonight. I'm just tired. I don't think I'm cut out for life. Could really use someone to talk to. Because I'm so ready. This really feels like it. I've been dealing with this for the past 10 years and it feels like it's hitting the peak where it's finally time, it's finally going to happen. Because something is so broken in me this time.

"I don't even know what to say.I remember a time when I had no idea what it must feel like to be depressed. Forgive me for not knowing exactly how to phrase this, but for the past few months I have been in a complete and utter funk. I'm graduating late from college, and my self worth and happiness has gone down the drain since I realized this was going to be the case. I live with my parents - my father works very hard and attempts to tell me he is ""proud"" of me but every single day when he comes home a fight breaks out. If I work an hour less than 40 a week he rips me a new one. If I am not pretending to be ""in a good mood"" then I get ripped a new one. My mother is a recent cancer survivor which is a good thing, but it has been two years since she went into remission and she has yet to gain any of her life back. Most days she sleeps from dawn to dusk, sneaking cigarettes and fighting with anyone who catches her in her lies.

My grandfather, who also lives with us, just recently suffered from his second stroke. I've just had it. I don't know where to turn or what to do. I just can't shake the feeling that all of my problems would go away if I just killed myself and was done with it.

"Question from the education space Hello /r/teenagers !

With many schools moving to remote learning, I wanted to get a sense for what some teachers are implementing that's actually effective for high-school students. I'm much less interested in the teacher's perspective than the students so. Some questions I'd love to hear from you all on:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Is there a particular teacher who is killing it at remote learning? What makes their process so much better than your other teachers?

\- Are there any in-class tools / software that are actually enjoyable to learn from?

\- For those teachers who are not transitioning well to remote learning - what's the main issue from your perspective?",0

"Want To Tell SomeoneThrowaway account for obvious reasons. 17F, for context.

I've been feeling suicidal off and on since May 2015. Last September I told my mom, who reacted unhelpfully (""Well who will babysit your siblings?""). She did take me to a therapist, but instead of acknowledging the hurtful things she says to me, she claimed that I was suicidal because of something my grandparents said 5 years earlier. I was an emotional wreck at that point, and went along with it.

I saw the therapist one more time, but that was still with my mom in the room.

Since then, I've claimed to be fine, even as recently as yesterday. I had a depression screening before a doctor's appointment. I lied on every question.

A few weeks ago I kinda-sorta tried to kill myself (half-hearted attempt, gave up the second I felt uncomfortable).

Today I felt a lot worse. I have a plan, the means to do it, and the only thing stopping me is my religion. Hey, any reason is a good reason.

I am aware that this is bad, and that I need to inform my parents that this has been ongoing, but I'm not sure how to break it. I can't just walk up and say, ""Hey, I'm suicidal. How about the weather, huh?""

Any tips for bringing it up?",1
"I'm a failureSo I failed my midterm exam for this one elective. The results are 40% of the final grade and I'm not confident I could rely on the other requirements (reports and quizzes) to pull my grades up to get a passing score. And since I'm not doing too well on my other subjects this sem either, my chances of graduating with honors will be compromised if I fail this elective.

My Mom assures me it's fine if I don't graduate with honors, that she's proud of me regardless, but she's just saying that. I know *she* wants me to graduate with honors more than *I* want to graduate with honors. I know that even though she's never strict with me, never tries to pressure me, and is always the first person to tell me to take it easy, me not graduating with honors would break her heart.

I don't think I could live with seeing the disappointment on her face when she finds out. Even worse, I don't think I could live with seeing her *try* to hide the disappointment on her face. Just thinking about it makes my stomach churn and my chest constrict. It makes me wanna grab the sharpest object within reach. 

Of course I know killing myself would break her heart too. But if I'm gonna end up breaking her heart either way, I'd rather not live to actually see it.",1
"I just got off FaceTime with my girlfriend This is probably stuff thats a bit too old for most of the people on this sub but this is where I feel the most comfortable talking about it.

I just got off FaceTime with my girlfriend. We had a very long conversation about games we’d want to play together and how we could make a thing out of it by streaming and everything. During listing off games she started to fall asleep. She eventually said she loved me and goodnight and asked me to just keep talking. I had a whole conversation with myself about women’s sports vs men’s sports and other things similar. After a while I started talking about some more really personal things and then told her about what I want our future to look like.

She was asleep but I started describing to her how I want to get married. What I want to do once we are married. I talked to her about children and all the firsts that come along with them. Like holding our daughter at her first heartbreak and taking our son to his first baseball game. I let out my insecurities and talked about what scared me. I described all these amazing things and I hope they all come true in one way or another. I know she’s the one for me and she says I’m the one for her. I hope I can spend every day for the rest of my life showing her how much I love her.",0

"Is this real?First off, I'm not high or have done any illicit drugs. I'm 27F and majorly depressed, with PTSD, BPD, ADHD, GAD. Lots of letters, great. Currently on Wellbutrin XL 150mg and Adderall XR 25mg. I don't have any CYP2D6 enzyme activity. Now you know my life.

My chest has hurt all day, and I feel like something awful is going to happen. I was worried about a panic attack, so I took some (1mg) Lorazepam that has since worn off. It didn't help much.

I feel dissociated and like nothing is real, but that if I move too much to the sides I'm going to cause something awful to happen. I have to sit really still, inside (my skin) especially. Is this a delusion? I know it's not true, but I can't bring myself to move because ""what if?"". This includes looking at people and talking much. I need to minimize these things, or I'll cause something bad to happen. I don't know what the bad thing is, but I'll have caused it.

It's been similar to this all week. I can't live like this. It's too painful to feel in crisis every. Single. Day. It's exhausting. I've been chronically suicidal for most of my life (since grade 6), and I do honestly think that's the best plan. However, I don't want to do it out of panic like I'm feeling right now and failing. Currently, I'm torn between trying to avoid a doom that's not going to come by just doing it, or trying something harmful to see if I'm even real. I'm midway between crazy and sane. I don't know what to do, if anything. I want to hide somewhere quiet for a few days, like the woods (NOT a hospital, that's not good).

Also, I see a psychiatrist and therapist once per week, and I have no interest in going to the hospital because I don't want to lose 3 days min and/or have to deal with the hospital. I'm in Canada, but still. I have stuff to do (stuff I'm failing to do) but I can't just junk them.",1

"Gambler's fallacy?I don't think I want to live. I don't think I'm depressed exactly, nor am I walking around sad all of the time. I just have had enough.


I'm not enjoying life. There are minor things I can see the point of, but I would much rather not. I can't help but see reasons to continue to live as a gambler's fallacy. Nothing has gone as hoped for, I'm not content with life as it has been, so surely I'm 'exhausting' that 'bad luck', right? Surely things will change and I'll start to want to live soon, right? That seems to me like what most reasons NOT to commit suicide come down to. But take it out of the domain of 'life and death' and you see that that is gambler's fallacy. 


There's always the thoughts that life is what you make it, and so gambler's fallacy doesn't apply, but that doesn't change the root cause. I'm bored of this life. I once read that successful people are successful because they know when to quit. They know when to cut their losses. I think this is my time to quit.


By posting I'm not looking for anything other than to be able to put my thoughts out there without being 'worried about'. There are people who love me, and people I love. But I refuse to be the centre of anyone's universe, and it would be unfair to make them the centre of mine. But that takes away the possibility of anyone calling me out on my bullshit. So I guess I just want to be called out on it? Or maybe not.

All of my mistakes are catching up to me and I’m losing friends because of it. It sucks and I really have only one person to confide in, and they aren’t readily available. I know transitions are hard, but I don’t even have anyone to support me through it. My support system is falling apart and it’s my fault.",1

"This is the end, my only friend, the end.I was wandering a graveyard once, and there was a gravestone of a young man that read ""He was a testament to himself.""  Beautiful sentiment, eh?  Well, he's my testament to the end of my life, because nobody in my life will be saying or thinking ""He was a testament to himself."" after I'm gone.

I'd like to the jump of the Golden Gate Bridge: one grand gesture for an otherwise lackluster life.  I doubt I can wait a week for a cheap one-way fare, but who knows.  Would give me time to tie up the loose ends of my existence.  In my case, loose ends means unloading a massive collection of books to show for my pathetic life.  At times these books where my saviors, my friends, my life, but now they are just part of the heavy burden of accumulation.

The boring biographical breakdown: 27, gay male, jobless, without health insurance, broke, massive debt, failed out of college multiple times, abused as the child of a single parent, chronically depressed, on and on.

Before this point, I tried to make some sense of this thing called life, but I am tired of suffering.  I've read countless books on Buddhism, philosophy, self-help, and spiritual books.  I've filled journals with my feelings and bad poetry; I've been in therapy on and off for 11 years; I've tried various combinations of meds; I've called suicide hotlines, and I always wind back up at this point: wanting it to end, permanently.  I'm tired of trying, tired of existing.

So there you have it: the last testament of a life that was a perpetual grinding of gears, until -- I have finally had enough and am throwing myself on the gears to get the horrible machine to stop, break.

Thanks for reading.  It brings me a small amount to comfort to think I am being ""heard"" before I go silent. ",1

"So were in love with each other but Look, ive had a big fat crush on her since march. And recently shes told me she feels the same. I know, boys dream right? Trust me i thought i was too. Anyway, shes got a crush on me back. But heres the catch, shes got really bad commitment issues and relationships really super scare her. I know why too, its because the last two people she was with were super duper toxic. I feel like I'm different. I have never ever been mean on purpose to her, and if i realize i say anything mean then i apologise immediately even seconds after and feel like shit the rest of the day. So im coming over to her house tommorow and were most likely gonna kiss. No sex or anything im not expecting or even want. I know, crazy right. Sound pretty ambitious too. I prepare for the best and expect the worst so im prepared for any situation. Anyway x2, im just super hyped because not only do we have feelings for each other im also her best friend.

"how do you create distance between someone you were once close withIts an embarrassing scenario that makes me feel worsr when I think about it.

I have liked someone. We used to talk everyday via phone calls and text messages, and I became accustomed to our daily conversations. I tried opening up how I felt to her, about my depression. She is the only person I have talked to about this. but I feel suicidal because I was sexually assaulted and contracted something that still makes me feel terrible. Im leaving a lot of micro details out unintentionally because it is hard to cover a relationship, because bonds are special. 

For the record, I completely respect her and her boundaries. I just want to abide by what she feels comfortable with.

I seek advice on how to distance yourself from someone I have been thinking too much about. I want to give her space if she doesnt want me in her life, I love her as much to agree.

I deleted her phone number to prevent myself from trying to communicate with her, but i have accidentily memorized it. I have deactivated instagram, facebook, and deleted snapchat.

I could be overreacting. I just want to stop feeling bothered by my self proclaimed circumstance. 

this has happened before, with her and I. We stopped talking for a while. Then She texted me asking how I was doing. and we started texting again. Then I texted her a lot. I felt like i wanted her to be the only woman in my life. And that could be scary and overwhelming for people to hear. So i want to stop feeling it. i am not objectifying her, I have nothing but respect for who she is and all that she has been through.

I just want to be able to get over this.

"My failureLast night I decided to kill myself.  Obviously I didn't succeed.
It's not a new thought to me; the first time I tried, I was 11 or 12 years old.  My parents were going through what was essentially a divorce in every way except legally, meaning that they were emotionally and physically apart but still lived under the same roof ""for my sake.""  They still do, and they hate each other.
That was 5ish years ago, and after getting my heart broken by my best friend, I decided to do it.  Every hope and dream I had was shattered and out of reach.  I had distanced myself from the rest of my friends and my family was in shambles.  My beloved dog passed away just 2 months ago, and one of my friends I had made in the mental hospital jumped in front of a train just one month prior to that.  Why stick around?
I was so ready to do it.  I knew it would hurt like a bitch, but at that point it was 2 am and I was distraught and exhausted.
But standing there with the rope around my neck, I was suddenly accosted by what I suppose is my survival instinct.  It was as though I was every age I've ever been and every age I have yet to be all at once.  The little kid in me still wanted to grow up, go to prom in the spring, graduate, see college, buy a horse, fall in love...  And my future self seemed to be telling me that I'm being immature, and that as I grew older my problems now wouldn't seem so vast.  And then there was my current self, begging me to die.
I stood there for a long time before I eventually went back to my room.  I was crying, and my best friend was frantically texting me and begging me not to go even after he broke my heart just 2 hours earlier. 
Now I don't know what to do.  Standing there in the cold gave me some perspective (but I know that I'll most certainly get hospitalized when I tell my therapist all this).  I suppose that the hopeful little kid in me still wants to try, even though each and every wish seems wildly out of reach.

"Well idk if i had a mental illness, and because of that i don´t post this in the r/depressionThe motive of that is the fact than in my country, Argentina, we are in a bad economical position, and a family where don´t belive in therapy (althourgh i study psychology). I´m sorry for the crappy intro, let me explain. When i was 7 years old i had cancer, Hodking lymphoma, and i saw a lot of childrens dying close to me, in the moment i didn´t realize what that means. At the 10 yo, i begin to understand that, and had bad moments thinking on it, when i talk with my family they just say: ""Screw it, u maded it, you won, don´t pay atention on that"" that didn´t help. At the 15yo, i had a lot of problems at school, for my behavior... i didn´t talk at all with my partners and cut myself in class a few times, just to go home, then the school commend a therapist and my family takes it, but in the 10th session my father take me out, saying ""ur okey now, right?""  
Now with 20 i had a lot more of suicidal thoughts, and i can get over it, also i developt some kind of emotional dependence and it´s awfull. The only thing that keep me alive it´s the study, and the fact than i´m a coward, i know that if i had the chance to kill myself, i would not do it. I´m tired

And I told her how I think that's lovely. I wouldn't leave my family with a funeral to arrange or that sort of guilt. Yeah, I'd be a missing person, but they'd have hope that I chose to start a new life.

She told me that I could run away and start a new life rather than kill myself. She blames my parents for my depression and thinks that when I get away from them, it'll be better. No, that's really not it. I hate myself and my life and I have no drive to exist any further. 

I'm just so frustrated that everyone says, ""it gets better"" when I've been dealing with depression for nearly 5 years now and it's only gotten worse. It's unbearable now. Everything is too much. Like, for example, I have to take a defensive driving course (I panicked while driving right after getting my permit and got into an accident). I would rather kill myself than do the 8 hour course. Same with the prospect of driving again. Or going to school after break. Or waking up in general.

i tried so hard to fix myself. i did everything i was ""supposed"" to but im still trash. i exercised, i dieted, i took antidepressants, i faked confidence hoping itd eventually be real, i reached out to friends &amp; family, i did all of those at once. and *still* no one likes me. and im still just as depressed as day 1.

i dont know what else to do except kill myself but i cant even do that. im fucking useless.

"what can I do to help my friend?my friend has been struggling with suicidal thoughts for 10+ years and has tried to kill himself at least twice that he's told me of.

he has a lot of financial stress, his family took him to an inpatient care thing once and the hospital kept him there for 3 days and charged him him a huge bill that he can't pay and his family won't help him 

besides this he has just had a really really terrible hard life and struggles with mental illness as well. I feel so bad for him but whenever he vents to me I don't know what to say. I want to make sure I am being as supportive as possible, I know there's probably nothing I can do to help but I don't want to do anything wrong or not good enough

i'm just really scared for him. His mom has to get an abortion recently and today he told me he feels jealous of it because he wasn't aborted. Things he says to me are terrifying

He is such a wonderful caring talented person with so much ambition and he has so much good to offer the world.

mostly i just let him vent at me when he's upset but all I can ever think of to say is 'yes, that is really horrible I'm so so sorry you feel that way and i hope things get better. I wish I could help you' I feel like this is such a stupid and generic thing to say but I don't know what else to do. I am not good at speaking and i don't have a lot of life experience so it's hard for me to talk to him and relate to him sometimes but i just want to make sure I am not doing anything wrong. 

I try to reassure him sometimes that when he gets insurance from his work soon and can see a therapist things will get better but I really don't know   

he has the means to kill himself whenever he wants. he takes medication that requires needles so he has those around. it's scary ",1

I keep thinking about taking my life, which I do everyday. I was outside last night again and was probably home around 3 am. I went to the bridge and sat on it for a while then went home. Two police car passed by me on the way home and I was nervous they would recognize me since they know who I am now because of the attempts I've made this year. I did accidently met them one time on the way to the bridge this year and they had to pull me from the railing. So I get nervous I would meet them and they would know who I am. When I just walked outside I saw a police car that had stopped at a bus stop because of some another car they had stopped and I just looked in general and one of the police looked at me for some minute and I think I recognized him from another time and I kinda panicked and hoped he wouldn't see who I was. Sometimes I keep an eye out for the police and sometimes I don't.   


Anyhow, I'm here thinking of going to the train station later on or the bridge.

"i got caught for SH but lied about it, now i want to die much more
14 f. at school i had health screenings, i had to take off my hoodie. the school saw SH scars, and i had to go to the counselors. 

I told them that i scratched myself, because of a panic attack. because i knew that if i said that they were from razors and from being suicidal that it would become a very large deal. 

and i didn’t want anyone knowing i am. they made me tell my mom or they would call her. so i told my mom, it was because of anxiety, she knows i have it, she’s didn’t know i scratched because of it. which i did use to do, but the scars are definitely not because of that.

i know i shouldnt have lied about it, but i’m already very stressed out because they found out. i can’t imagine how i would feel if they knew about the real reason.

It sounds bad, but i don’t want help. it makes me feel  much worse . i was totally fine with how i was before they found out, i was content with that. 

But now they know and i have to go to therapy and my mom is checking my arm.

all i want to do is SH, mainly because of this right now. i don’t want any if this, i wish no one found out. i would be so much happier.

but i can’t go back, and i don’t know what to do. I only want to SH and die more because of this.

i know people want to help me, but i only feel worse. i don’t want to sound ungrateful, but i don’t want any of this. i feel worse then before, this “help” is making me feel so much worse. I feel 10x more suicidal now than before. i really just want to die right now, but i don’t have an accessible way of doing it. 

what do i do? has  anyone else gone through  something similar? honestly any feedback is appreciated. (i didn’t proof read this, there may be many typos i’m on mobile)",1

We were in an esports team right before covid and he was attempting to be team captain. And I’m pretty sure if he makes it on to the team he will get that role. And I’m afraid that he is going to try to fuck me over if he does get it. Or worse fuck over my friends. God damnit I am going to punch him if he try’s to fuck her over. Because she is actually knows about his BS. And she is starting to not hang out with him anymore cause of it. Which is good for her. The thing that pisses me off the most is that he talks to all of the other esports kids about me behind my back. And he hosts 90% of events and actively try’s to not include me or my friend refraction.

"Something I need to say Ive seen a lot of posts on this subreddit about how 'school is about grades not learning' or something similar, and I need to just point out that yeah maybe it is, but grades are a measure of how much you learn and the effort you put into learning, school is not that difficult and if you just put in effort like most teachers expect, then you will do just fine. There are a lot of problems with the school system (I live in the US so it might be better in other countries idk) Im not denying that but I dont think that the grading system is one of them, things like students being able to choose more profession specific classes should be talked about more, being able to see if you are interested in a certain field while in HS rather than having to spend even part of a collage tuition just to find out its not right for you. And yeah there are some teachers that are unreasonable, or not the best at teaching a subject, or just straight up should not be teachers but a majority of them are looking to help students learn but the students also have to be willing to learn and put in the effort to do so. Thats all I wanted to say, have a nice day.


TL;DR of this is basically stop complaining about school and just put in effort, its not that hard. There are other bigger issues with the school system.",0

"Help controlling intrusive thoughtsI've been having interrupting thoughts about suicide and they're ruining my day-to-day functioning, by a lot.Before I felt like I could manage it. I could go into autopilot and put these thoughts at the back of my mind. Self-harm usually helped with controlling them.

 Now, it feels like they won't go away. Sh hasn't been helping. I've stopped feeling any release from it. I've tried self care, getting a nice shower, eating a good meal, spending time with family, watching wholesome videos, try to be nice to people, etc. Anything that is recommended. Anything positive that would jerk me awake that I don't to think this way. Nothing's been helping. I feel alone as ever. The hollowing feeling of being utterly alone and having no one who would care is eating me up from the inside. I don't know what to do to help with this.

And it's so constant. I would be doing something normal and these thoughts would take over me and I'd be left thinking of my death in the worst ways. I want to get these thoughts under control. I don't want anyone to know that there's anything wrong. It would create drama that I don;t want. I also want to put these thoughts on the backburner for a while.

"I feel bad when people are not with me. Title isn't clear about what I mean, because I actually have no idea how to express my problem, so im just going to describe.

I met a guy on this discord, we are basically brothers. We treat each other like it, we love each other and we even met irl when we found out we're from the same country. But here's the thing:

He got a new PC, and started to get into the PCMR comunity, spending all day playing games (and working when he has to) and talking and laughing with his friends, and doesn't give me any attention (or rather, rarely does so.)

I really feel sad because we used to be so close and now I feel like I'm less important than a random ass game. As well as his friends. I'm supposed to be his closest friend and brother, yet he spends more time with other people (that are his friends).

I really feel like I did something wrong even though he says I didn't, I really miss the times where we'd meet and talk everyday all day, instead of me messaging him ""Morning!"" (he doesn't live with me) and him just being already awake for 2 hours playing games with his friends and me waiting 5 hours until he takes a break just for a ""Hello""

""Why don't you play games with him?""

Whenever I invite him, he just DM's me in game ""sry im with friends""

I know I am also wrong. He has a life, a stressful one indeed, and games are his ""escape"". But before his PC, ***I*** used to be his escape, and I really mis those times... I also get extremely angry and have a mix of feelings I can't describe when he's with someone else other than me.

And that specifically is what I want to fix about myself... Anyone that had this problem can tell me how they worked it out? I don't feel like this mix of bad feelings I get is not good, at all.

-The second part is the will to stop. If you don’t have that, you won’t stop.

It has been also harder to resist the urge. Mainly because I have the virus and I had to stay all day home for two weeks.

I’ll maybe post another update soon.",0
I simply don’t like BTS... Every online class I go there’s always those BTS obsessed freshmen. I’ve tried given them a go and it’s so bland and repetitive for me. Every song and video is just BAM BAM BAM and all the same. I have no idea why their fan base is so huge and topping the charts. I’ve given other KPOP groups a chance like Blackpink and actually enjoyed. I’m convinced it’s all the looks and style. Don’t even get me started about the fan base...,0

"Please read this before you leave(TL;DR at the end) I don’t mean to encourage suicide, but I like to point out the fact that we won’t even “die”. From our point of view, it’s like we’ve fallen asleep. You can’t know exactly when you have fallen asleep. You can’t be aware of being asleep unless you’re dreaming. In the same way, when we die we won’t experience death. We suddenly go unconscious similar to falling asleep. We cannot be aware of being unconscious. Since we don’t wake up, we are unconscious forever and at that instance ABSOLUTELY NOTHING matters. You don’t need to worry about your parents missing you because after passing you no longer have a brain nor do you exist from your perspective (at this point, the concept of perspective doesn’t even exist) . You might as well have never existed, so why don’t you live?


TL;DR So what I’m saying is, we all die anyways and when we do it will be like we never existed from our perspective. Because of this fact, you should keep living. ",1

"Goodluck to everyone in 2019I'm just tired of all the insane bullshit from everyone, men to women to black to white to straight to gay and all in between. I've been working on myself through therapy for the past 14 years and it doesn't seem to be helping me. In fact, I feel like I'm getting worse. I've been trying every dating app under the sun (tinder, bumble, okcupid, PoF, coffe.meets.bagel, bbw meet, black people meet, match.com, bi singles, etc.) And yet here I am still single through all of it with not even a simple kiss to show for it. I constantly work out and exercise and still no attention. 

People are severely unkind and I'm so ugly apparently that even when I have a mental breakdown, no one seems to notice or maybe they just don't care. People on here keep saying to cut out all toxic people from your life to be mentally sound. 

Of course that sounds logical and great but then I found myself all alone. Everyone seemed to be incredibly toxic: family members with their lack of knowledge on mental health issues, friends and co workers with their degrading comments and gossiping towards people who aren't like them (like seriously one guy complained because this woman eas taking off from work weeks at a time....for chemotherapy. Who bitches about that). It's all so toxic I constantly feel like I am still in high school despite being around people close or in their 30s. 

I'm just tired of it all and this will be my last time on here. I just wanted to say, to this sub in particular, thank you. I hope all you women have good, blessed, and happy lives in the new year.

"To moderators for r/teenagers i have been working hard to make relatable memes for my fellow teenagers, but they seem to be a poaching bot that doesn’t allow pre made formats. i feel like the addition to u/MAGIC_EYE_BOT was nice because it eliminates possible reposting, but the bot just completely removes any post with pre-made templates. 

For example: I have uploaded 3 different memes that I made with mematic, which were (not fully) origional content. i used a template and psoted my fresh relatable meme about a school scenario, and poof. 1 minute later, my post was removed because of: “identical or slihtly modified image recently posted here”. i think you should have the bots programmming reconstructed so the bot can depict the difference between text colour, position and other tags on post, so the meme doesn’t get taken down because of possible repost. im honeslty so mad about this because I see other memes using the template get posted, and not taken down.

Over the year I spent $7200 of the 16k I made in the summer on video games

Come September I knew I would need to pick up shifts at my dads place in order to pay for expenses (DR Trip, school expenses, etc). I neglected working last semester than during Christmas break I relapsed my gambling addiction and spent 1300 (on my credit card bill for feb). 

Now I am forced to work 3 days a week in Jan at my dads place (7:30am:4:30pm) while doing my unpaid internship for school Tuesday-Friday (6pm-10pm) Saturday 10am-4pm). The only bright side is after January I only work 2 days a week at my dads place. I am there until the end of March. 

I should add I am someone who values there time. I would much rather do what I would like than spend my time in the office of a factory.

I need braces and 8 theeth removed. I'm over weight and have a sugar addiction. In the 19 years I've been alive no man has ever told me i look beautiful which adds on to the self hatred. When I told my friend I've never kissed anyone they laughed at me and said that was embarrassing. I feel worthless, lonely and an overall disgusting human being who doesn't deserve to live. And why should I when everyday I wake up my heart physically hurts from all the emotions I keep inside. My mom asks me what I see myself doing in the future. I say I don't see myself doing anything.

I had my plan all set for tonight. Straight up suffocation by pulling a cable tie as hard as I could around my neck. I suppose the fact that I would struggle for breath terrified me a bit, but I had no other means. I felt a peace today as I knew (thought I knew) that I would be ending my life and not having to deal with it anymore. Yet when I printed my note out and was on my knees with the cable tie around my neck, not having pulled it yet, I was so hesitant. My family would be hurt, my friends even, but I know eventually they would get over it. Why should I have to be such a burden on them for much longer? 

I've been struggling with depression for 5 years now, 22 year old male. With two other attempts under my belt, I told myself that I would be successful with the third.

Its hard to see any bright future out there, hold on to any possible hope that would help me. It looks to just be a continual cycle of pain and suffering. 

I feel as though I just cant take it anymore, and why should I? I hate going through this and I hate thinking these thoughts. So why not just end my life and not have to worry about it? Why can't I just do it? Why? ",1

I had a nightmare last night and awoke from it with the surest feeling that I want to die.  It was crystal in its nature... I’ve never felt it so clearly and strongly before. I am sure that if in that moment if I had a gun I would be gone.  I am overwhelmed with memories and feelings from past trauma.  I am endlessly tired but so afraid to go to sleep because my brain makes up terrible nightmares with content one million times worse than the trauma I actually endured in real life.  I have a bottle of pills and some liquor or access to a firearm if I drive to my parents house for it and I cannot find a reason to not go through with this.  My boyfriend is exhausted and I highly suspect that he doesn’t love me anyway and unfortunately he is one of the only pillars in my support system.  Fuck.  I can’t fucking do this anymore.  ,1

hi. so if you look in my post history you will see about my pregnancy scare and then i posted everything worked out bc i thought it was my period and all that but it was a miscarriage. i wasnt expecting a kid and i didnt want one but i still feel like a piece of me is missing now and all of my trauma that ive worked so hard to get past is back in my head in reoccurring thoughts and nightmares i have no interests anymore i hate all the tv shows i used to love , the only thing i want to do is sleep but when i sleep i have awful nightmares. i dyed my hair and cut my bangs the whole breakdown thing but i dont feel any better ive never felt this awful before. im not gonna kill myself or anything like that, i just cant shake this feeling i wake up every single day and just feel so empty like there is no reason to even be awake i try to hangout with my boyfriend i but i cant even stand being cuddled or kissed and i just cant stop crying all the time for no reason and i try to hangout with my friends and family but i just zone out the whole time.

"Thoughts please ?I'm 21
I want to have the option to impulsively kill myself when I get in a certain state of mind. I think like this occasionally.

Theres alot of stress pushed back in my mind involving my studies and morality about our purpose here and how I owe it to the world to live a certain  way.
When I start to really think about life it seems hard to do what I know is right.
I can hear myself burying down the right decisions and it's easy. 
I know I'm a piece of shit, theres so much I should and shouldnt be doing.
It feels too late to change.
It feels too easy to just ""get by"" like I believe most people might.
Knowing ""everything works out in the end is exactly the problem""
I think it might be honourable to kill myself rather than have my life piss by repeating itself meaninglessly.
It really feels all or nothing sometimes.

Escorted and forced to go to the hospital,kept there and observed by cops and transported to the loony bin handcuffed and thrown into the back seat.  Then stip searched, loaded on meds.  You have no say in what you want to take, when you want to sleep, and have nothing or do but wander around and watch whatever they play on the single television.  Then you ar ekept there until you lie and and pretend you are no longer suicidal, or your insurance runs out.  This has happened to me twice.

Details of why i am doing it now are on the post i just put on r/depression. I've tried before with bars and alcohol (also in my pervious posts) but that didn't work either time. So i'm making sure i will die this time. I'm gathering all the medicines in my house right now. I'm making sure i mix as many stimulants and depressants as possible. I will bar myself out to make the whole thing easier to go through with. As well as drink to get my body to the brink of death. 

Edit: just took 20 mg xanax. Drinking as soon as it kicks in. Then i have adderall to speedball and hopefully 500 ml of night time cough syrup will finish me off. 

Edit2: found some of my LSD earlier too. Took that bc i like LSD. It'll keep me conscious until the dark abyss envelops too i guess which will be cool.

I'm looking through pictures of life. Trips i went on, fun times i had.. Grace.. bitter and painful nostalgia needs to prevail as the decision is irreversible now. (Just drank)

Edit3: bars kicking in. Slightly drunk as well now. LSD is beginning to alter time perception. No regrets. Still looking through pictures. Kind of crying but i'm more happy for my pst self that he found a way to go on for such a long time. Good for him.

i’ve been on again off again suicidal for roughly 6 years. i was hospitalized about 5 times and since my last visit i was actively trying to improve myself and genuinely started to feel better. some shit hit the fan in my life and for the past several months i’ve been feeling very depressed and suicidal. 

sleeping has become more and more difficult as i lay in bed and a sudden wave of “holy fuck i need to do it” hits me.

"I'm just tiredI'm tired of life.  I'm 22 years old and I feel like I've experienced all the good I can experience in life. 

I'm not a good boyfriend, I guess relationships like that just aren't for me.  I'm just so much of a loner.  

To that all off, I have a small dick to boot so sex is nothing great.

I want to be able to enjoy people's company but I can't.  I can't drink alcohol because my heart starts racing, my face turns red as fuck, my eyes feel like they're going to pop out of my head.  New years eve was pretty sad for me.  I just sat at home, what kind of 22 year old goes to a party and doesn't drink?  I didn't get invited to anything anyways.  

Life gets hard and people turn to substances to ease it.  Weed or alcohol for the most part and yet I can't do that.  I have to be sober my entire life.  I have to take life without any help.  

It's cold as fuck.  My job is outside, I hate the cold.  It was around 0 Fahrenheit the other day here.  I was miserable as fuck.  Being that winter just started I'm in for a lot more of those shitty days. 

I'm tired of life.  I'm lonely.  I'm not good at maintaining relationships.  There are a lot of good looking girls out there that I can never have a chance to talk to.  I'm tired",1

Sometimes I almost seem to calm down, or the energy turns into excitement instead of anxiety for a short amount of time, but it won’t last! None of my usual coping mechanisms (good or bad) are helping, I can’t focus at all, I’ve barely done any school work and since it’s the beginning of the second quarter, my grades have already dropped, I’m failing two classes, I’m trying so hard to get it done but I JUST CAN’T!

"Please give me ideasSo, I’m from Brazil and I’ve been treating my bipolar disorder with a nice psychiatrist since April 2017, going to therapy since January 2017. I’ve relapsed twice last year and ended up in the hospital, since the first relapse I can’t have access to my meds for obvious reasons. I’m doing a lot better, quit my job which was making me feel like shit, changed uni, change courses, basically a whole new world, feeling my princess Jasmine fantasy. Since I started going to uni for gastronomy I’ve been thinking about moving from Brazil to another country(who am I kidding? I fell in live with LA the second I put my feet there) BUT I don’t know how that could work out, how would I take my meds if I can’t have access to them? And I don’t really feel like I should have access to them either because even though I’m doing great for the past 6 months I have no idea when this stupid bipolar shit is gonna go down because I know it will at some point because it always does and I’m very afraid of relapsing again. 
I’m only going to be able to move after I finish uni (probably December 2019) but I have to start doing plans if I really want this to happen. 
I do have family friends who live in Mission Viejo which is close to LA but it’s a little too far to be in contact with them everyday. What do you suggest? ",1
"I need a real reason to live.Intellectually I know I shouldn't be saying this, because if it was anyone else I would be saying ""there is so much to do and live for blah blah blah"" but I don't see the point in myself. I have missed so much and felt humiliated for so long and every little thing just makes me want to kill myself (e.g. sharing a belief I have and everyone else I'm with when I say it look uncomfortable and awkwardly leave the room.) I would ideally leave and surround myself with more supportive people but to do that I really need money, and I can't handle a job in my current state. Which means I will have to wait even longer before I can actually move on from anything and I don't know how much longer I can take it.

"Google Meets is pure sexual energy. 1. Google Meets only allows you to see a maximum of 16 faces at one interval, it’s satisfying, yet holds this air of mystery and allure. It makes you wonder who else you haven’t seen— what aspects of Google Meets are hidden from you.

2. Google Meets is far superior to our program, although we are not allowed to use Google Meets unless Schoology is down— therefore, the relationship with Google Meets is forbidden (unless given permission for a brief session where we will not be permitted to express our live), only making it more alluring.

3. Google Meets is often unpredictable— yet unpredictable in an interesting way. You never know what will occur during class. It keeps the relationship fun and new.

4. Google Meets is constantly asking you to rate their performance. They are adamant to improve, and that drive is attractive to many.

5. Google Meets values the individual, one of the many reasons they don’t have breakout rooms—  Google Meets only has eyes for you.

The intrigue and devotion, the forbidden romance, the intelligence and drive... the BDE.

This is what makes Google Meets so sexy.",0

"A Case for ContextHello, readers of SW. Like many of you tonight, I sit here contemplating the most basic human instinct of self-preservation. 

I often think of how one suicide can compare to another. How one suicide might influence another. How my own suicide might be interpreted by anyone I know. Context seems to be so important. 

I have dealt with daily suicidal ideation for 10+ years. Last summer these thoughts became worse than they ever have before and on July 1st/2016 I unsuccessfully attempted to take my own life (obviously). Since July of last year, I began to actively seek help for something I knew had been negatively impacting me for years. 

Today, well over a year later, it feels like it may have been too little, too late. 

I read posts here trying to understand suicide. It seems like the context can often be lost in a text-based post. More importantly, the mental state of the reader has a much bigger influence on how a post might be interpreted. 

I have been trying to understand suicide and depression for years. I completed my degree in neuroscience, I became a senior volunteer on the suicide hotline after volunteering on the line for for over 2 years, and recently I just completed a nursing rotation on the acute care psychiatry ward at the hospital (many patients being admitted for suicide attempts and/or severe depression). I don't understand it. 

I thought I had something more to say, I'm sitting here at work on Christmas Eve. I am 50/50 on if I am going to make it until the end of the year and fairly certain that I am not going to make it through 2018. 

I have the rope, I scouted a good spot, I can tie a pretty good noose at this point. The majority of days this year I've ended up on the floor crying. Most days are spent in fear of when the next breakdown is going to happen. I've been to psychiatrists, tried different regimes of antidepressants and different exercise routines. This is still where I am at. 

I've wanted to die for long time. What more can be said?",1

"I would like some adviceHello, you all beautiful people. Im 23 M, and i wasnt been doing so well. Well mostly opositive. My father died this year, also my grandfather and my cousin. I still have my mother and brother. I myself graduated college with financial degree, but im strugling to find a job in my field because of the lack of any social skills, i never had much oportunity to practise them and i cant work under pressure very well. I avoid people in general, and after few months most employers write me off. I been working in some low paying jobs, security guard, wharehouse operator in store. But im  from eastern europe and i get paid very little. Having hard time sustaining myself, cant afford a car, barely have any money for food after rent. The only hapiness i have left in internet. But this year after 3 funerals i really feel broken. Also i have a gf, but now she lives in different city and i havent seen her for awhile and dont want to burden her with my problems.
So yea, this is the only place i can share my story, dont really have any cash or will power to visit psygologhist. I was thinking of emigrating to another country, but i dont really have any contacts or skills. I really feel useless and have no motivation anymore. If anyone is interested, no i dont drink, do drugs or use any medication.

I cannot waste any more or their time and resources trying to get better because it's a lost cause, I'll never be better. I decided a long time ago that my life would end in suicide probably when I was around 30 or before then if something else worsened and I was still alone. I knew when I was 15 i was going to end up alone. I am not interesting enough, or special enough, or skinny enough, or pretty enough, to be worth someone's time.

I think I have depressionI've think I've had depression for the past year of  and recent events from my life have added to it. My mom is crazy. She constantly talks about how the FBI is following her and my friends have stopped coming around because she calls them all narcs. My brother had enough and started living with a friend. I don't have any close friends that I could go live with and if I have to keep living with her I'm afraid I'm going to kill myself. And I'm not close to any of my family members because my mom ran them all off. My dad left when I was young and I haven't heard from him since then. Listening to music used to be my only escape but now I can't even do that because whenever I try to I just feel a wave of sadness wash over myself and I think about how I'm using music to escape from my shitty life. I used to feel sad about things but after a few hours I would forget about it but now when I feel sad (which is all the time) I just keep feeling that way which is why I think I have depression. I'm also scared because I just started drinking alcohol and that is the only time that I don't feel like killing myself and I'm scared I'm going to become an alcoholic. I have literally no one in my life that I can talk to these things about so I have to post to reddit. I'm scared to talk to a psychiatrist because I know if he gives me any drugs I'll end up abusing them like anything good that happens in my life. I also started cutting myself so that's just great too. I don't even know why I'm posting this its not going to help. I'm just going to go home stare at the wall and fantasize about dying.

I don't have disability and probably wouldn't be able to make it quickly however disability paycheck in my country don't cover even basic physiological needs. 

Recently I've got from ophtalmologist a note that my eyes are fucked up due to high bp. So +1 disease. 
  
That's just too much drugs and too much medical advice for me. Given that I don't have any savings and currently unemployed (though I don't believe that anything will change in the future) I believe soon I wouldn't be able not only to pay for health but even to buy myself food. 

So I'm deeply fucked. And there is no hope, no way to get out, nothing to be changed. Well, there are some people for whom suicide might be quite an option. Rationally speaking. 

I'm definetly going to do this since my departure would make some people's life only easier. The other wouldn't be bothered. 

The only thing that bugs me - the whole transition phase. I've always been scared to die in my sleep, I've always wanted to experience death in real-time. Just to be able to kind of observe my last moments in real-time. 

But looking at chances and suicide statistics - well, It wouldn't be possible. I'm too scared of ropes. And there is no way I could have find a gun. So I'm going to die being unconscious. My last experience would be falling asleep, not experiencing death. 

The last couple of months I was hesitating, struggling back and forth - whether or not to do it, maybe I would somehow adapt, maybe I would be able to live. Now I'm finished with lying to myself.
 
Good luck. ",1
"No friends, no family, no reason to liveAs the title says I literally have no friends. My ex-best friends are two faced backstabbing bitches and I haven't made any new friends since. I still don't hate them as much as my abusive parents and sister though. They're all dead to me. All my other family members are strangers since they live in other countries. I have no one. All I do every single day is go to work and sleep. I'm only 20 and I can't imagine having to do this for next 45 years until I retire. And then do what for 20 years after that?

It sucks to say but the only reason I haven't killed myself yet is my dog. I don't want him to go to an animal shelter or anything. He's old though, he'll probably die in the next year or two. And then my time will come. We're all going to die anyway, so since I don't like this part of ""existence"" why not just skip to the end?",1

"Childhood feeling died 3 years ago.It was all i enjoyed in my life. It has always been there, since the beggining, but it decided to leave me at the age of 13. (Or it died) and now i see the world as a boring meaningless existence. Cant have my dream job. Can't achieve this, that. I sometimes imagine having a peaceful home, and a great big field yard, but i will have to fucking work my ass off everyday, every second. So it would be pointless.

Childhood feeling made me feel like i was in a dream. Such happiness, and a mysterious feeling. There is no way i could feel it for sure. It gets worse year by year. I become even more feeling less, to the point where i am just so fucking careless. To commit anything illegal, hurt myself badly, die. It no longer scares me. Shoving a fork in the outlet doesn't scare me. I just think... ""this is just how it is"" 

So on September... if my sister doesn't get any shrooms, lsd, dmt. I will kill myself for sure. 
Edibles made me feel amazing last summer, but i've been too long sober, that drugs don't even feel like a good idea, but that is a lie of my mind.

Q: What do you get when you cross a mentally destroyed 17-year-old dropout with an upcoming 18th birthday.

A: A suicidal, mentally destroyed 17-year-old dropout 

I can't even handle life as it is. I've been stuck in my house for 3 years, I have severe C-PTSD and DP/DR with no help and nowhere to get it. Please, don't give me any advice. Believe me, I've tried and considered every possible avenue. I'm fucked no matter what I do.

"I see life as a pointless sequence of actions, and it bothers me.So, basically, Why do we live at all? If we cut off all religious things, we will be left with ""live to be happy and make others happy"" or ""live to reproduce and make sure next generation lives in a good world"" ~~bullshit~~.

Why do I so sceptic? Because science has found the meaning of life in it's purest form: **to reproduce**. We live to reproduce. We suffer to reproduce, so new ones could suffer for the same thing. And all happy things we have in life is either something we found or created just to justify our lives and distract ourselves from the painful truth. 

The world itself is meaningless and exists just to exist and die, like everything does.

Yes, I do enjoy life sometimes and everything, but it's just a chemical reaction and kind of stopgap.

And at the end of the day. Life still bothers me, my life situation bothers me, my future bothers me. Despite the fact that I know it's pointless, worthless and meaningless.

&gt;Why do we still here? Just to suffer?

&gt;...You feel it too, don't you? ",1
"I have no meaning in my life, no friends and no hopes for a better future..Started uni this fall and it's really stressful and I have no goals with my education so nothings really motivating me. I really like the subject but it's just not worth the effort. I think I expected too much going in to this. I thought I was going to meet people who were like me. I guess I forgot that even if those people existed I wouldn't get along because I barely open my mouth unless someone is asking me questions. (In middle school people harassed me whenever I said anything so I gradually got quieter and quieter till I just didn't say anything. And I haven't really ""recovered"" from that, I've basically been socially isolated till now.) I've been struggling for a long time and it's a miracle I managed to move to start uni. I feel like this is where it ends though. I'm so close to giving up.

I don't think my life has ever felt worth living for. I've always escaped into fantasies about things being good. It's lead me to make poor decisions chasing weird fantasies. I've realized this now though and I'm trying to spot when I have them but I don't dare to dream about things anymore. I want a nice car and house but that's not going to fix anything. I think what I need is to better myself so that I can have healthy and meaningful relationships and a source of income. It's just so difficult and I honestly just want to end it.

"I feel both under- and overstimulated at the same time The context for me personally might be a bit specific, but maybe others have the same problem as well.

Currently I'm in senior year of high school. Our government arranged it so that seniors are allowed to go to school (to properly prepare for all our exams), but we still have to keep distance. I think it's pretty understandable that you can't keep 20-25 students in one classroom while also keeping distance, so they decided to split classes into two. One group goes to school normally, and the other group follows the same lesson online via Zoom. This switches everyday.

However, I'm not in the group with ANY of my friends. Granted, I don't have many, but I'm not in the group with my best friend, not with my, well, not-so-best friend but a friend nonetheless, not even the person who I would not consider a friend but we talk regularly (but I do like them). I would've accepted being in the group with that person, but no, I'm completely alone!

This all has caused loneliness and stress. Stress because I have to keep track of everything and because of the half-online lessons the quality of the lessons has degraded.

Add to this that my home situation isn't great either. My mom cares way too much about the things that I'm not worried about but doesn't care when I am worried about something. I don't eat healthy, and, I feel anxious of being judged by my parents when I do try it. They probably aren't doing that, but I still feel like it. Personally I'd like to speak with a therapist about everything, but they won't allow me. 

But back to my original problem, I'm lonely, stressed, and bored. I feel like this is the reason why I'm feeling like this, and honestly I'm also not really sure if this is something I am able to get advice on or if I just wanted to rant.",0

"Severe Anhedonia and Social AnxietyI'm 21 going on 22 this coming April. Life is hard. Life is a disappointment. Life is boring. especially when I'm losing interest in everything I have ever found interesting - guitar, girls, music, movies, tv, food. The world seems really dark in this state, having nothing to live for and when I don't even care anymore if i lose everything i have right now. It's extremely tiring to just wake up from bed, get dressed and go to my part-time job. Sometimes i stay in the office an hour above required because I have no where to be.

Having social anxiety doesn't help. I pretend I'm fine everywhere i go with fake smiles and fake uplifting tones. When no one is looking i turn around and reveal my emotionless face. I have no reply when someone talks to me. My mind is blank. I'm tired. Tired of when I'm talking, my 'friends' may stop talking but they don't listen at all. They just continue on with their story and forget everything I said. I'm tired of this. I keep the around just so i don't feel embarrassed when i walk around alone. So I can tell my parents i have somewhere else to be rather than sit at home when I'm not at work.

I've attempted suicide before by overdose of pills but i was stopped by the police when one of my friends called them. Even then my parents don't understand.

The pills were from the local Mental institution for help me stabilise my mood. I hear voices in my head. They're not as bad as what some other people experience. Mine just talks to me. I wish they were actual real beings because the voices seem to care about me more than the real people around me.

"I can't even kill myself in my dreams.Back before the stress got to me, and sleeping at night became harder, I used to jump straight into lucid dreams. These days, I have to rely on the triggers I've trained myself to realize to take control of the dream. Lucid dreaming was a nice escape. Still is on days that I can get long enough sleep. But a good night's rest is rather rare these days.

Anyway, after a rather loud argument with the parents, I took a nap. My way of shutting everything out for a good hour or two. Sadly during that nap, the argument continued, you guessed it, in my dreams. I managed to say in that dream what I couldn't say in real life. I guess that was my mind's way of really getting out what I was thinking. I still remember the conversation, five hours later.

I took control and called up a knife from my collection. And no these aren't cheap chinese knives. I mean actual quality knives. A blackwashed Kershaw Cryo II in this case. When I opened it, I tried stabbing myself in the head. But then it closed. So I tried again. The knife refused to stay open, and until I woke up, I was just banging the closed knife against my temple crying on the floor wanting to die.

Guess who woke up crying?

Why so many people suffer with mental illness yet the resources to treat and rehabilitate are limited and often very expensive?  

Why some counselors and therapist insist that we are ""normal"" because we are well educated, have gainful employment, appear physically healthy, etc. (does this disqualify us from experiencing crippling anxiety, deep depression, or suicidal thoughts)?

Anyways I finally get to sleep at around 1230 and she wakes me up at 430 and tells me it's  my turn again. We have a big fight about it, now she is sleepijg and I'm taking care of baby. 

I take mertazapine at night which makes is difficult for me to get going too.

I'm at my limit, I can't do it anymore and I am at the point where I don't even care. How can you care when the other person doesn't.

If you are seriously depressed don't even think about having a child, worst mistake of my life :(. I love my baby but it's not fair for anyone involved.",1
"My crush stopped paying any attention to me. Should I give up? I used to talk to my crush, who is my classmate a lot before we had holidays, she often laughed at my jokes and seemed to have fun around me. 
Now she just doesn’t care, we have no interactions and she ignores me when I’m saying  a joke or something.
She now talks to another guy, just like we used to, laughs at every single thing he says and stares at him all the time. 
It might me my fault too, before the holidays I talked to my close girl friend a lot right in front of my crush, but if she really liked me would she change her mind that fast?
I really can’t stop thinking about this, I can’t have any more fun now, just thinking about her makes me incredibly sad.

"I can't forgive myselfNew here, using a throwaway account.

I've been struggling with mental health issues for a long time. I've gotten much better about being open and honest with friends and family, and I've received a lot of support from people who care about me.

My problem arises from the fact that I did some really repulsive, horrible things when I was a teenager. Everyone who knows me tells me I'm one of the most kind, caring people they know. This should make me feel better about myself and my situation, but I wind up feeling more angry and more hopeless every time someone tells me that, because they don't know what I've done, and if they did, they wouldn't want anything to do with me.

I guess I just don't know what the fuck to do anymore. I really don't plan on killing myself but the thought is in my head 24/7. I'm constantly fantasizing about how I'd do it, and where, and what I'd leave behind for people who know me. I hate myself for thinking that way because some of my friends and family have committed suicide in the past, and I still feel the empty, hollow feeling they've left behind. I would hate to let anyone else feel that same way, but sometimes I feel like I deserve it.

Recently I stopped drinking and doing drugs (I've never been a huge drug user, just semi-daily weed use and the occasional stimulant or psychedelic) in an attempt to gain better control over my emotions, but now I feel less in control than ever. I've set up a meeting with a therapist, but it's not for at least another week and I don't know if I can last that long without doing something stupid. I recently started self-harming after many years without it and I feel ashamed every time I make another cut on my arm.

The support that makes other people feel stronger just makes me feel like more of a worthless, shitty person. All these people put their faith in me and offered me their strength, and I've already let them down because of some idiotic decisions I made years and years ago.

I'm a bad person and I don't deserve anyone's love. How can I get that across to my friends? And how can I live with myself?",1

"I will go crazy, i can't take it anymore, my brain doesn't work please somebody help meI have been depressed for almost 2 years. I have no friends at all. I am completely alone, nobody wants to talk with me in high school and my teachers don't help me either (they rather keep their distence, because I am repellent and not talented enough so it's not worth caring about me). I obviously fell so bad, I cried almost every day in the school toilet, I just could't stop it though I knew that I had to be strong. The worst part is that I feel like my brain doesn't work.

My life’s miserable, I’m the outcast of my ”friend group” and I’ll only get invites to things if theres no one else.

I’m angry all the time, I end up pushing people away by insulting them even tho I don’t even mean the insults, I just can’t stop. I’m a piece of shit to everyone even my family.

Have had the same friends since kindergarten and only made like 3 since then. Being constantly picked on for my temper and it’s only bringing fuel to the fire. Don’t find joy in things I used too anymore. 

Have social anxiety and can’t speak to new people because I’m afraid of what I might say and then pushing them away. Can’t even hold a normal conversation. 

I’m no one special, I’ve spoken to my parents and a therapist but it’s only gotten worse. I don’t do anything other than sit in my room and play video games and browse the internet. 

There’s literally nothing left for me to live anymore. I’m just alone and I will eventually push everyone away and be all alone. 

If just somebody would have helped me at a young age and tell me I would have turned out like this I would have maybe been a different person. But here I am, some waste of oxygen no one likes.

Even if I got better what would I get back into, the same life that’s miserable and just makes me want to kill myself. I just don’t know if it’s worth trying anymore.",1

Party on fridays, sit on the beach after midnight kissing girls. I can only dream. Fucking fucked off about how other people are luckier then I am. Cunts. Fuck them all.  I've had it, I have no groups, no friends to turn to, cause they're all fake assholes. Never ever ever ever ever chat to me on facebook, nothing, no likes, no friends no nothing.

"Why is killing yourself seen as taboo?Seriously, it just seems selfish that people don't want to clean up the mess. What about me? What if I don't want to live anymore? Life has nothing to offer me.

I'm only getting older and gradually, my energy and youthful appearance will fade away. Why should I have to live through that? Things will only get worse before they get better. I haven't even truly been happy since I was 12 years old, and now I'm 26.

The world just keeps trying to invent ways to make it impossible for a person in my situation to even get out of it. It expects you to puts lots of work in, but even when you do, it just shits all over you and gives you nothing. People on /r/jobs won't even properly give me advice on what to do to find a job. I need a real job. My student loans are eating me alive, and their answer is always ""Fuck you, I got mine.""

I'm done living in this world. I'm done living this life. I just hope there's some form of afterlife or that I'll be reincarnated and have a better chance at another life, but even I'm skeptical of this.

**Edit:** I appreciate all the replies, but honestly, nothing has convinced me that I should keep living.

Other things I'm dealing with:

* I'm 5'5"", 130 lbs, and look like I'm between 12 and 16.

* I've never had a girlfriend

* Still a virgin

* Never kissed a girl sober

* I have so little life experience beyond actually having some friends between 22 and 24. I have not many fun memories I can look back on. And all everyone my age wants to do now is get married and start a family, things I don't want to do.

* I hate that I'm 26. I wish that I was a teenager again and could do things that I missed out on.

* Overall, I just fucking hate myself and my life. I just want to die. ",1
"New poem I wrote, title is Untethered. Plz give feedback  The stars will not look down without pity,

And I will not look up without pleasure.

Untethered by nature, unnurtured and bound

In leather and spikes, hear the roar

That will come from the rear,

Bullets and bikes, my homeland, my cry.

Rapture comes in waves of steel,

And heavy black smoke too thick to be real.

Death is a choice. The ride is a steal.

&amp;#x200B;

Risk is a given, but what can I say?

Anger within says I like it that way.

Freak by spite. Bane by right.

Untethered I roam, I wander

Beneath where stars may groan,

I shed my skin and peel my face,

Because I’m untethered to this world,

Untethered to my life,

Untethered to whatever you think is right.

The lifeline means nothing.

"Suicide bringing relief?Note: I am not trying to encourage suicide in any way with what I am about to say. I have always wanted an open discussion about this, and this seems to fit. I am not trying to intentionally offend anyone, but if I do in the process of expressing myself I do apologize. 

I have had suicide ideology for about 10 years now. I did not realize my thoughts had a term for it until last year when I committed myself for mental health treatment (nothing to do with actively trying to commit suicide).  Lately, I have been seeing suicide as a relief from life. When I think about it I feel a bit calmer at the thought of not existing anymore. I feel a sense of warmth that comes over me knowing I do not have to deal with life, and that makes me mentally smile in a way that I can never genuinely do in life.

It’s ducked up thinking, I know. I also feel that the only reason I feel guilt about thinking this way is Bc of how suicide is thought of in society. If I didn’t have the influence of what the general culture feels about suicide, I would be fine with my thinking.

Why would I want to? I feel like I’m just going through the motions. Just existing. Just doing what is expected, and achieving. Sounds typical, right? I have reached all the typical milestones that someone in their mid-twenties would achieve. My thinking is “is there more to do?” I would rather just fast-forward to the end and die. Why wait to experience this feeling?

My family will be okay. It would suck for them temporarily, but I’m okay with that. They have been okay with a lot of things that were not okay and hurtful. They will get through it. I feel as if it’s the best decision for me. If i decided to carry it out sooner than later I will be prepared to do so. I feel happiness at the thought.",1

My mother is not taking me seriously and she think that going to a church will solve all of my problems, but I am not a religious person at all and going to church is the last thing that I want to do. I have told her this, but she continues to make excuses as for why I am feeling this way. My dad also does the same thing, so I am at a loss and I have nobody to go to at this point. We aren't the most wealthy family, and I understand that a therapist can be costly, but my mom insists that if I get one she will have to get rid of some of my really important belongings, which is not a risk I am willing to take since they are all I have at this point.

"I Wish My Suicide Was SucessfulI don’t know if I’m alone on this feeling.

Last fall I overdosed on a pretty hefty amount of pills. I took 20 gabapentin pills and about 400 extra strength acetaminophen like a dumbass (since that sort of overdose is apparently a horrible way to go) and ended up in the hospital within 3 hours bc I was violently vomiting :).

I was in ICU for 3 days and known on the third floor as some “miracle child” because apparently other people have overdosed on less and ended up dead.

I don’t feel like my recovery was a miracle. The more I think about it I’m jealous of people who were able to actually go through with their suicide from start to finish. 

Over the course of the past few months I’ve still wanted to kill myself nearly everyday and now it feels like I’m out of options. I can barely swallow a single pill—the meds I’m now on for my bipolar—without gagging. I’m too much of a bitch to jump off a bridge (although I used to say that about overdosing and I was able to do that). I don’t have access to a gun. I don’t have a car for carbon monoxide poisoning. Slicing my arms seems too painful to me. I fucking failed at the only thing that would have ended my pain.

And now I can’t stop regretting the fact that I lived. I think about it and regret going to the hospital in the first place. I regret not trying to leave the hospital bed when they were saving me. I feel so stupid for not realizing that I finally had a way out. And I fucked it up just like everything else.",1

My mom is never supportive, the only reason I get to go to school is because it would look good on my ""marriage resume."" I did want to go to law school, but now I dont want to follow any of dreams. Im only allowed to go far I have to stay at home and commute if I want to go to school but most of the good law schools require me to stay over there so ive given up on it.  I have a boyfriend and I love him but I want to break up with him to save him from the all the negativity I bring. I feel like im weighing him down. Im sick of my parents but I also dont want to hurt them and i dont see a solution or a light at the end of the tunnel. I genuinely want to swallow a whole bottle of pills but I dont think I have the courage to.",1
"I don't know how much longer I can keep living in 2020My whole life is on pause in 2020, at first I could look at it like a needed break but now I'm directionless, I'm probably deferring from university, and I've failed so much of it already I don't know whether to bother continuing. Everyday I'm in chronic pain, I was meant to have surgery for it but the corona virus has pushed it off the schedule from the hospital indefinitely. I don't have a support system anymore since my friends are all scattered across the globe now and can't reenter the country. I'm not close to my family and I'm getting resentful that they never check in on me. I cant be the only one whose going through similar things this year. I don't know how much longer I can live in this void and I don't know how to change my circumstance. My coping mechanism are gone, my support is gone, and any hope I had at a successful future is dwindling  as well. I really don't know who to talk to about this, I've tried to book therapy and seriously nobody replies and I can't afford to look for specialised practices.",1

Nothing to live for.  No one to share my joys and tears with.  Only thing keeping me going is my dog.  I fantasize about giving her up for adoption (I know a family who really wants her) and just kill myself finally.  I can’t work out the details though.

"I'm looking at the gun right now that will end my life. Over the past couple of decades I've grown tired of human interaction. I find people impossible to deal with. Due to my lack of social skills I was unable to keep a job. Even the lowest of goals cannot be reached due to my mental condition. When I go outside and look up at the sky, all I see is a prison. A gravity well that traps me on a dirt ball with others I'm incapable to interacting with. I've tried drugs and therapy, I've tried volunteering and just finding hobbies. None of it interests me anymore. I've even reached out to reddit before with my problem. I know that was a futile to try. It's not like anyone here has the magic bullet of reasoning and linguistic skills to solve my problem. The only bullet that will solve this problem sits in the chamber of this .38 revolver. Looking down it's barrel reminds me of a tunnel a prisoner would dig to escape though. Salvation lies on the other end of this hammer. Before the sound of it hitting the primer, I'll be free of the bars inside my head. Understanding that is first time I've felt relief in years or maybe ever. It slows my breathing and can feel the muscles in my face relaxing. This is the greatest feeling knowing that I can end it all now.

she just says she doesn’t want to hide that she still finds other dudes cute and that she just finds me more attractive and better and thats why shes with me. 

took me some time to get over that but my moms making me question if this is normal or not. i picked her up from work recently with my mom and she told me a story of a guy that tried asking her out and that she thought he did something funnt and he was really  cute and she felt bad rejecting him. afterwards my mom told me she really didnt like her talking like that and said shes really scared im gonna get hurt.

"Joe mama virus vent: Is it me or does it seem like it’s still unnatural to go outside. I know corona is still not over, but it feels like it is. Many places in my area have opened up, though with a mask policy. I just find it so odd. It’s probably because I’ve hardly been outside besides groceries or work. Like the other day, I went out with a few friends and asked me if I wanted to go to this restaurant. I was confused at first because I thought everything was still closed. But apparently not. It still feels so odd to me. It still feels like corona just only happened. It still feels like that time period where everyone was playing animal crossing and post about how “they’re gonna be productive during quarantine”. I still don’t believe that my “graduation” happened. It just feels like time is slipping by. I honestly don’t know how to feel about it.",0
"TarpitI plan on killing myself in two days when my partner is on the job.  
I failed. I can’t work a job long enough to get out of my tarpit.   
And social security won’t work out because I never was able to form a bonifide doctor patient relationship to prove my disability in the eyes of the judge, at least according to the lawyer's advice.

&amp;#x200B;

It hurts because I've been asking for help all my life from DFCS. And I feel abandoned by the whole system, doctors, schools, police, all which downplayed my abuse and never got me the help I need.  


Now I am a barely functional 27 year old. Who wanted to kill themselves at James Dean age, and then Curt Kobain. And I keep on moving the date back because I always though there would be a support system or a safety net. But there are none. I get yelled at my partner for crying and making autistic sounds. If I had money I could afford a good doctor but instead I am on state given rural health providers none which are qualify or feel comfortable prescribing me psychiatric medication which hurts my case for disability. Paraphrased from my lawyer if I were really fucked up I would have been receiving treatment. Cruelly setting aside the history of me reaching out for help COUNTLESS TIMES and framing it as if it were my fault.

"My girlfriend is suicidal. Help!My gf of about a month (I've known her for years) recently told me that she is depressed and has already been through 2 attempts to end it all. I love her very much and I want to help however I can but she is extremely pessimistic about the future and I simply can't propose an argument to why she shouldn't be. This situation is tearing me apart because I have anxiety and my brain always thinks of the worst case scenario when things don't go smoothly.

Today we found out that her favorite band canceled their visit to our country but they would show up sometime later this year for sure. I told her it's OK, they'll be coming again so when that time comes we'll go together. She started saying things like ""who knows what's gonna happen until then"" which made me worry too much. So I asked what could possibly happen, but she wouldn't give a straight answer. I then brought up that I'm worried and that resulted in her saying ""I'm not going to say anything ever again. I shouldn't have opened up that day at all and I don't want to open up anymore. You already know too much.""

How am I supposed to handle this? The whole thing is eating away at me slowly and all I want is her well-being. It should also be noted that we are about 2 hours away by car, which makes things even more difficult because neither of us has a car. ",1

"I'm so lost. Help me please.I don't know if I can do this anymore. I've completely ruined my whole damn life.

Almost 2 months ago I broke off the engagement with my ex who I was with for 18 months, and now I hooked up with a girl and her and I were together for 3 weeks and I loved the sex and the relationship. But alas, I couldn't stop thinking of my ex.

Well her and I broke up last Friday, and right after her and I broke up, I went and slept with my ex. Now I don't know what I want. I have 2 girls who really want me, and I don't know who would be better for me. I feel something for both of me. And I'm getting pressured into making a decision.

I stopped taking my anxiety meds because they made me want to harm myself even more than I already do. I just don't want to wake up anymore. I don't want to do anything anymore. I find myself skipping class, and I'm supposed to graduate with my degree this semester and I'm fucking everything up.

This isn't me, and I don't know how to find myself anymore, and I just can't take this. I hate myself. I hate looking in the mirror. I was hurt by my ex, but I keep thinking what if shes changing for the better and I can be happy. But then I have people telling me that the other girl is better for me, and not to go back to my ex.

I care so much what other people say/think and I absolutely hate hurting people. And in this situation someone has to get hurt whether its my ex or this new girl. God, I really hate this so damn much.

I tried hurting myself the other, all I could do was hold the knife up against me but I couldn't go through with actually doing anything. I want to feel physical pain because that's better than the mental pain I'm going through.

"My passive-aggressive e-mail to my teacher Hi friends,

So, my aunt has decided that the best way to motivate me to do homework is to claim that I've lied to her about when I have school, claim that I've missed almost all my online classes (I haven't), and claim that my dad doesn't love me because I don't do schoolwork. In my haste and aggression, I sent the following e-mail to my teacher:  


&gt;Hi Ms,  
&gt;  
&gt;Can you please confirm that the class is at 12:00PM so that my aunt believes me and doesn’t think I’m lying to skip online class?  
&gt;  
&gt;Also, have I missed any classes so far? I can’t remember and my aunt seems to think she knows my schedule better than me :)  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks!  
&gt;  
&gt;\- RebelTrueflame

Fortunately, my teacher took it well and confirmed that she did indeed change the time of my class from 10:00 to 12:00. My aunt still doesn't believe me but that's alright - I just hope my teacher got a good laugh out of my passive-aggressive e-mail.

Bye for now :)

"Why can't I feel anything? Don't even want to eat anymoreI'm sorry for this long post, but I just feel like I can't cope anymore. I'm struggling with feeling this sense of complete hollowness. I've felt this deep sadness for years and it just won't go away. But it's not sadness where I can cry, it's just this consuming emptiness. I'm so so tired and numb and it makes me lash out at others just to feel something. I hate myself for hurting those around me but I just can't stop. I'm always so irritable and easily set off. I don't know why I overreact and make small issues so much bigger than they need to be. I just feel this immense build-up of pressure inside of me and it's like I'm going to explode if I don't let it out on someone. It's pushing people away from me because I just can't apologise. 

My family thinks I don't apologise because I think I'm perfect or something, but that's so wrong. I know how imperfect I am, I think about my faults constantly and I can recognise when I've done something wrong but I just can't bring myself to say sorry, but then the guilt eats me up. 

Just feel so numb and empty all the time. It's been so long since I could genuinely feel something. It hurts so much to think back to when I was happy because I can't see myself feeling like that again. I don't find happiness in the things that used to make happy. I don't even enjoy music anymore despite it being the thing that used to be my favourite. I don't feel like listening to it, I just skip through my Spotify playlist because I don't feel interested in any of it. Not even going out with my friends makes me happy. I know objectively I should be happy with my friends, but I feel like I'm behind a glass wall and I can see their happiness but I can't reach it. I don't even feel like eating. Eating feels like a chore to me - nothing sounds or tastes appealing.

"My own perspective, if it makes sense to anyone.I can only speak for myself, so I don't know if this resonates with others. For various reasons, I have flip-flopped between being suicidal and not suicidal my entire life. I don't know that I will ever be happy. I also think I'm talking out of my ass right now and I need to vent.

I think that there is a difference between wanting to be dead vs. wishing to never be born. The obvious difference being that one is easily achievable while the other is impossible; but also it is a different perspective. Wishing to be dead is suicidal thinking; wishing to *not exist* isn't exactly the same.  
I've wished I wasn't born for most of my life. I don't think I've wished to die more than once or twice.

After watching the animated movie *Coco*, I learned about the cultural practice of 'multiple' deaths.  
~~First death: when you physically die~~  
~~Second death: when your body is laid to rest~~  
~~Third death: when no one is left alive to remember you~~  

(I found a slightly different version of the first/second death that I prefer, as it is more relevant to me)  
- First death: when you first learn that people *can* die, and you come to face the reality of mortality. ^(Presumably some aspect of our inner child dies in that moment.)  
- Second death: when you physically die / body is laid to rest.  
- Third death: when no one is left alive to remember you.

I have never lost anyone close to me ^(mostly because I've never *had* anyone close to me) but I was a logical child. I don't know when it came to me, but I experienced the first death quite early through sheer logic: science class, maybe? Living things die. It just ... made sense.

In combination with bullying from my brother (and the resultant low self-esteem) and basically having no friends, this has shaped me to self-sabotage so many things about my life.

Yes, I need counseling, I'm sure.  
No, I can't afford it.",1

"My late diagnose of autism ruined my youth, my parents tried to hide my autism, I just can't accept it. I suffered a lot of injustice.I was diagnosed with autism when I was 18, before I just wasn't myself. The primary school was okay, I was still able to function fairly socially and I had quite a few friends. I was almost never bullied. High school was hell, I did not have any friends and you could see on my face that I was very bothered by the environment (I always looked angry). I could not function at all socially, people became angry / frustrated with me because having a conversation was not really going and never could / dared to say something in class and thus became a target of bullying. People wondered several times what was wrong with me, but I didn't know it myself (but it was my autism). The last 2 years of high school I was completely isolated from the rest and severely depressed, social just did not work at all. People were walking over me, I was quite anxious at school. As I describe it, living with autism without knowing it is like you are using a device without knowing how to use it because you miss the user manual, and i was kind of like a zombie. By the way, I did finish school. At My follow-up education, I also had no friends and it was a repetition exercise, but even worse, not much difference was also bullied. And when I was done with that I was at home for a year, I didn't want anything. Then I talked to the doctor who had me diagnosed for autism through someone. And then all the puzzle pieces fell into place, it feels like I've missed a part of my life. My parents also tried my whole life hiding my autism, because my mom was ashamed that she had another child whith autism, my older brother was diagnosed at the age of 4-6. My parents never talked about autism so I did not know anything about it. My dad also has autisme but he refuses to give in, he knew at a late age he had autism. He wanted the same thing happen to him with me, he also screamed a lot at me and beaten me up a lot as a kid. I am so down/depressed.",1

"Help pleaseHello,

I'm a 38/m and I think I've had depression off and on all my life but things have been really bad since 2016.

Since then I have quit 2 $100k+ jobs. I am now almost 3 months into a 3rd job and have to quit and this was the last chance I gave myself. Since 2016 I've spent about $60k living off savings when not working.

Not sure what to do?

I would like to quit now while my boss still likes me and I could use him as a reference later. If I stay I know over next 1-2 months I will disappoint him and lose any reference. That would end any future career (3 jobs with no reference = I'm done).

I was forced to sell my house and move to a tiny apartment. I will soon get the remaining of my savings from that sale. I would like to give away that money to family and then kill myself. If I don't do this, I will just live off the money until it's gone and then kill myself anyway after 2-3 years which is a huge waste.

I have a dog I really love and there would be no where for him to go so I always have the worst dark thoughts about killing him with me and I hate it.

I have a small family that is not close and my Mom is disabled from a stroke and this money will help her live for the rest of her life. I have few friends that I've neglected over the years and have no plans to reconnect or tell any of them any of this.

Over the last \~1.5 years I have not been able to get any pleasure from things and have done nothing social. This is not an option as I struggle with clothes and normal conversation and am not a fun person to be around.

I tried for Disability benefits before quitting the last job and was treated as a huge fake and denied even with my doctor's support. My doctot gave me psychiatrist &amp; therapist references, but I threw them away because I thought I would get better on my own. Now I've been waiting for a psych reference for 8 months and can't wait any longer. I do not want medication (I took Escitalopram since 2014 and quit that on my own 6 months ago).

Hoping someone could give me some ideas to avoid killing myself or pathways to get better that I have not thought about.",1
"I want to dieI got into a heated argument with my dad, long story short he told me to kill myself. I told him that I would. I've been thinking about committing suicide for a while (since I was 14, now I'm 18) but my mother started screaming at me that I'm being selfish and shit like that. 
I hate myself way too much. Death seems like the only way for me to stop being a burden to everyone.
The only thing that's keeping me alive at this point is my boyfriend. And that's it.",1
"Is there any reason not to self harm?I don't see an issue. I'm four months clean of self harm now. I don't see the point of keeping it up. I have no friends. I'm careful, I won't bleed out or get infected. No one notices. And I like it. I've already been put in a mental hospital so they won't put me in again because now it's a ""pre-existing condition"". There's no point. I can't keep doing this. Something happened today that really hurt me and the only thing I can do to make it better is cut myself. Is there any logical reason not to self harm?",1
"I want to die so badlyAll the time. Constantly. I don't wanna live with myself. I can't, I fucking can't. I don't wanna allow it. I can't write my name without feeling shame, I can't talk to people without feeling disgusted. I wake up every day with a swirl in my stomach. 

If my mom weren't here I would've done it. I wish I could go though with it, i just live for her. I'm gonna have this constant feeling until I die, just for her. It's gonna be a hell.",1

"It’s unfairWhy do I have to be told everyday that I’m retarded, worthless, ugly? And then I think that too. It’s unfair that I get targeted. I don’t want to be here if that really is what I am. I don’t want to be feel unwanted constantly by others. 

I get that it’s high school but honestly I don’t want to end up as a fucking mess in the future. I don’t want to be socially inept and lonely. I’m angry and I despise the people who continue to do this SHIT. I’ve had to go through this crap since middle school and I don’t want to now. I thought it would be better since I moved. 

Another thing in this crappy rant, I’m tired of feeling weak and being belittled. The main friend group I’m different from because we’re different genders and so forth and that is a big deal apparently. I’m tired of feeling like I am an outcast because my friends are also considered “weird”. 

If I tell the counselors and I did about people being assholes, suddenly the person acts fake nice and I have to feel bad because of that. I hate this I don’t want to be here and I will die if this is what my life is going to be like after high school. 

I’m sorry. ",1

Im in the arts and have surpassed the age of the new kids coming up. I'm not trendy, part of an organization, im afraid of who I am and what I feel and all I've ever wanted to do since I was an angsy lonely artist was get to be myself. And with age, I'm further and more afraid than ever before.",1

"I've been thinking about my life in 2019 and early 2020, and man I'm glad that period is over. Lost my grandmother January of 2019, had depression for a few months after that, then I was diagnosed with Inattentive-type ADHD (ADD), quite late to be diagnosed but it did affect my self confidence a lot. Went on a cruise and almost drowned at a beach. Broke an iPhone XR, then broke a XS which I got fixed. Then I went through a train wreck of trying to find friends on Discord until I finally found some, then lost them, then I made my own server and it actually was really successful (500+ users), I then got really stressed for having having run that server so I gave it to a friend, and then later regretted that for months. Then 2020 came.... my parents helped me gain a lot of self confidence back during quarantine which really did help. It was around June when I felt ready to stand up again, so to speak. Meditating on all that now and wow is it an interesting memory. 

Yes, it's not as bad as a lot of what you guys go through, but it really was one of the worse parts of my life. Now I have friends, I'm no longer shy, my parents trust me a lot more, and I've just been happy, even with what's been going on in 2020.

Moral of all of this, don't give up. A lot of you might be going through a lot of awful and painful things, but know that even if right now is awful you'll get through it, and then you'll feel happy that you did. People care for you, and whatever you are facing, if it's big for if it's small, you will get through it. 

I'll be turning 14 in a few weeks, so I hope for one great year of my life.",0

"Mentally, I’m a vegetableOver the past couple of months, my life has gone to absolute shit. The events that took place, caused me to lose control over my mental health, and I can’t really contain myself anymore. My brain won’t let me focus on any important task for more than 10 minutes, and whenever I do, suicidal thoughts jump into my brain. This has caused my grades to severely drop, causing my parents, who know what’s going on but refuse to acknowledge the severity of it, to pressure me to get them back up. The fact that I physically do not have the mental capacity to get these grades back up, paired with the recent loss of all but 1 of my friends, and many other issues surrounding my life right now are making my mental state similar to that of a vegetable. I’m afraid that I’m not going to be able to mentally function in society if this keeps going on. My life is going to plummet, and there isn’t going to be anything left to live for. Right now I think I’ve decided that I am going to wait 3 months, and if I’m still in the same mental state I am now, I’m gonna end it. I really hope it gets better, but I don’t want to have to live with it if it doesn’t.",1

"Really bad time with break-up and no friends.My boyfriend broke up with me - this was the best relationship I've ever had, except when we had an argument he'd gaslight and he ended things when I pointed out his behavior. This is DEVASTATING and I'm struggling.   


I have no friends at all which means no support to help me through this.   


I am long-term unemployed (I can't see this changing any time soon as I need support due to disabilities, I do volunteer) so I have a lot of time but no money to do things like find new hobbies or meet new people - I actually met my ex via meetup, so even trying to meet new people that way is difficult as he's an active member with lots of friends in one of the best meetup groups and right now going to meetup groups would likely just upset me. To add salt to the wound an old ex from eight years ago, the second best relationship I ever had (I ended it because it went stale and we weren't moving forward after five years together), has just announced he's getting married to the woman he met after me.  


So...

* Bad break-up
* No job.
* No hobbies.
* No friends at all. 
* No future/stuck in the same place in life.
* No job or partner means no children and time is running out.

The break-up is the big factor, everything else just means no way of dealing with that and I'm now sat focused on how bad my life is as well as how incapable I am of making any progress in life after about a decade in a similar situation. 

I am on a waiting list for therapy but it'll be a while yet, I don't find things like suicide helplines etc. helpful, I really need to be around people and to have support to help me actively do something to make positive changes in my life.

"So many of us wanting to die every dayI come here often. I come here when I think ""yes, I've decided now"". I come here wanting to leave behind something. What's life if you leave nothing behind, right? But you can't leave anything behind with friends or family because we're repeatedly told we will hurt them by killing ourselves. So the only course of action is, try your best for your friends and family to have as little memory of you as possible, but leave a memory with strangers. 

I'm a doctor. First, my job made me ill - the hours, the stress, the repeated infections from colleagues and patients (but especially colleagues). Then I got CFS/ME taking medication for my depression and suicidality. Now I got sick again in March from a colleague. I have begged work to let me do some things remotely - meetings and telephone consultations to happen from home (as they do for many of my colleagues who have different supervisors) but my supervisor doesn't agree with this. So here it is, once again I have to play with my health, go out and risk COVID-19 or some other infections just for some phone calls to people or to type up letters. I can't even stand for more than half an hour but sure let's make it worse again.

I tried to apply for jobs, even as a secretary, for the past year. No luck. Now with the pandemic there aren't even any jobs. My family all lives abroad. Their country's borders are closed. I have no friends - my health drove them all off. Probably not helped by my charming depressive personality. 

I've made all preparations already. I've started to say goodbye to a few people. Letters, finances, everything is taken care of. I'm relieved everything is ending finally. I just wanted to leave some memory of myself somewhere. To say that this happens to doctors too. We get depressed too. We get sick too. And like everyone else here, there is nobody to take care of us either. 

Thank you for reading, and goodbye.",1

"66 daysHalloween is my deadline, I'm not sure why I picked that. It seemed far enough away to give myself time to fix things but close enough to not be forgotten. 

I had something perfect and I ruined it because I wasn't good enough for him. I hope I can make myself good enough. I would do anything for this man. I dreamed of a future with him and he seemed excited about it too. He told me he's never met a girl like me before.

 I am scared to die but ready to do it if things don't work out. I would rather have an eternity of nothing, or Hell, or whatever comes after death than continue living in this world knowing I can't have him. This is my first boyfriend, my first breakup, and it will be my last breakup no matter what. 

I lost 30 pounds since we broke up a month ago. I don't do anything except exercise and work and lie in bed and sob and think of him and think of how good it will feel to have him want me back. 

I don't know what I want from this sub. Do you think theres a chance he will take me back? Do you think he will forget about me? What is a method of suicide that will leave my body looking like I'm just sleeping? I don't want to hurt whoever finds me more than I know it will. I don't want anyone to have to scrape me off of a wall.

I want to die in a comfy armchair sipping something nice, and with Doctor Who playing in the background. I want to feel really tired and doze off to never wake up again.

My apartment is molding and falling apart, I didn't do my fucking taxes because I procrastinated (I haven't told anyone this) and I'm absolutely terrible at my job, in which other peoples lives depend on my performance.

"I don’t know what else to sayI’ve been feeling really lonely these days. Despite hanging with friends and shit. Got a lot of problems going on at home. A lot of inner struggles. And just been expecting too much of my friends. 

It’s like I want the perfect answer. But it’ll never come. Every night I ask myself what the fuck am I doing here. Play this same fucking piece on repeat. Over and over. It never ends. 

Nothing is enough to feed my pain. 

In all honesty. I know my life will end in suicide. Nothing will stop it. Tough love, softness. Nothing. I’ll die one day by my own hand. All I can blame though is myself, for not having the strength to hold on. 

My purpose in life was to live, feel pain and then die. And bring pain upon those I love so they’ll understand mental illness and how serious it is. How misunderstood it is and how it’s often swept under the rug. To many people think mental illness is a choice... it’s not. I didn’t ask to be fucking depressed or suicidal. 

Hopefully I can survive tonight. ",1

People who find the statues offensive should indeed look upon them in disgust and hope and strive to be better.

"Been ghosted by a woman 2 times in a row, I'm going to end it, I hate being 26 and forever aloneSo the past 3 years or so, I met two really awesome women.

Shortly after Lucy ghosted me. I met this new girl, we'll call her Mary. Mary was cool, not really as cool as Lucy, but she gives me a lot of attention and talks to me daily which is awesome, as it helps keep my mind off of Lucy. However, recently, it's been 24 hours since I got a response, so I'm sure she's ghosting me too. 

I just REALLY want a girlfriend. I'm tired of being 26, and never been in a relationship. I honestly feel like women are out to get me. I honestly am starting to HATE women with a bloody, seething, raging passion. I don't want to feel this way, but I am.

I'm going to commit suicide before I turn into another Elliot Roger, because I don't want to end up that way.

"My semester is about to start and I'm a little disappointed my school is handling the pandemic so well Is it selfish of me? Yes, 100% but I really expected us to all have the exact same scheduling and treatment but they're handling it super well, no more than a few people in the library and other buildings, all classes are online unless it's a class that has to be in person, and even then not many people are in one classroom at a time. I think masks are mandatory too, the guidance counselor even put a big plastic wall in a room that separates the student and her and says it's a ""mask free zone"" to help people be more comfortable. Why do I wish they didnt handle it so well? Cause I am a very social person, since quarantine I've been out with a friend once, which is already too much. I cant see my friends because we dont have the same classes so I'm back to where I was before, but this is for the best so I'll suck it up",0

"Addicted to sadnessI wanted to kill myself this morning. Things go better. I'm happy now. I'm happy right now, but I want the sadness with me. It comforts me, in a weird way. I'm starting to understand how to be happy again, but the depression is trying to pull me back. If I cry anymore throughout the day, they'll all be more disappointed. I'll get more detentions. I'm taking a baby steps. I've never been so relieved when one of my doctors said there may come a time when homeschool would be necessary. 

I'm supposed to be happy. I've got a roof over my head, I have no family problems. Just problems with myself. I feel so sad for the people who have worse problems than me. Good luck to everyone, though.

I'm hanging on. Not for me, but for my family. 

People are disappointed in me. I haven't told them I'm depressed again. All I do is cry. If I do that again, I'll get in trouble. School is not a place to cry. 

My grades are raising. I turned in some work. 

I need to be happy, but I'm not.

There's a demon inside me. I never want to go out anymore. All I do is sit in my room thinking how easy it would be to take all the pills. Jump in front of a truck. Hurt myself. I'm hoping this will all be over after high school. I'm having my doubts, but I won't know till then.


The sadness is addicting. Please tell me if anyone else feels the same. ",1
"I hate myself.This is the thought train I've been on for awhile now. And I absolutely despise and hate myself for it. Yet I can't stop going down this trail in my head. All I can think about is being dead and killing myself because I'm a vile and worthless human who shouldn't be allowed to walk the earth any longer. 

This is my thought trail: 
All I see is everyone around me getting jobs left and right and me not even being worth an interview. I see myself, working miserable fucking jobs since I was 16 and working my motherfucking ass off for this useless piece of shit of a degree and I see me getting paid $8.25 an hour, while my gf, whose had everything in her fucking life handed to her on a silver platter, not start working til she was 20, not having any degree of any sort, in the work force for a bit over 6 months, getting a fairly decent job that pays nearly $10 an hour. That's what I see. And it makes me want to shoot myself.

This isn't the first time I've ever thought about suicide. It's the first time I've ever really wanted to do it though. I am a selfish awful person who just needs to go.

"I just don't feel like living.Been depressed for the past year and a half, with low and high tides of thinking about suicide, but I'm pretty sure I could count the days in which I haven't thought of just ending it up on both hands.
  
Every day I just think ""I will kill myself"", I open up my eyes in the morning and that sentence goes through my head, then I get up, clothed and look in the mirror, not liking what I see, ""I didn't shave properly yesterday and there's a patch of longer hairs here and there, golly how fucking stupid I must've looked when I went to class yesterday, I should just fucking end it"", I go for my every morning smoke and look at the trees and judge each one with stronger branches, ""Which one wouldn't break if I were to hang myself?"", etc. and these thoughts go on and on until the moment I lie back in my bed and close my eyes, just thinking of ways I could do it or just random reasons why I'm stupid and lazy and not really deserving of life, since I'm just wasting it away day by day. I know I'm not going to achieve anything in my life, not that I even have any aspirations or passions. I used to think that if I had money then I would be happy but when I lost my job I started cutting back on expenses and realized I don't really need or want much in life.

First of all: I am male, 27 and have had a decent life.

I am pretty sure that most people want my life. Steady job, nice wife, awesome pets and good income. I am just not happy with anything. I feel like I am human garbage. I can't stop thinking that everybody would be better off without me.

My pets need more movement but I'm too depressed to do that. I'm making them unhappy.

"Compulsion is getting pretty persistentTrying to keep things short:

I guess I'm described as having dysthymia? Anyways, my emotional lows never get too low, and my highs are non existent... anything that gets me feeling remotely good is very transient. I think this is the way I naturally am, nothing is especially bad about my life (currently in college).

Honestly, I don't think I can get much more out of life, I have no passions or anything I want to pursue. I've some how managed As so far in my college career but things slipped a bit last semester. I don't care so much though. 

Life isn't bad but it doesn't feel worthwhile. I can't imagine anything that would make it so. Even the thought of having great wealth and travelling the world freely barely draws any sort of reaction out of me.

However, I do sort of want something: to buy a revolver and stick it in my mouth. I've researched prices and how to execute it to ensure death so I guess it's a pretty serious want. Sort of problematic because a part of me would also like to find something to live for. I guess there's still something in me that hopes but I'm fairly certain that I won't find whatever it is because it doesn't exist.

More frequently now I will get bouts of sadness that physically manifests itself as a shooting pain that originates on the left side of my chest and runs along my left shoulder. This is usually accompanied by a compulsion to kill myself.

I'm working out n' junk to try to lift myself out of funks. It helps but obviously it's not enough. I do have hobbies and stuff that I do with friends but meh. I went to go see a university therapist, she said that sessions might not be helpful to me because I don't really want to help myself. Which is true I think.

The first global pandemic in my lifetime taught me how fragile my financial situation truly was. Out of desperation, I finally started a small online business.

I've been depressed for almost a year straight. It's so fucking exhausting. I'm tired of it. Every time I think I'm close to getting out of it, bam I'm fucking myself up again. The most mundane shit tips me over the edge, and I'm ready to just end it. I hate it so much.

"So tired, too tired...Ah, I don't even know what to say. I'm just so f'ing tired. I've battled suicidal thoughts since I was 11 or so, sometimes stronger and with me every day, every waking hour; sometimes less so, maybe only popping up a few times per week, but never really leaving me alone.

I want to get better, I just don't know if it's going to actually happen, it's been so many years, I don't know of any other sort of life. I'm 29 now, it must be around 15 years since I have been able to get through one day without finding some excuse why I would be better off dead.

This is so tiring, I can't find any reason why a ""life"" like this is worth living, I am not truly alive. I try to cling onto things I still want to see and experience, but I really do not know why I even try, most of them are entirely unreachable for someone like me.

I want to experience life so badly, but it all just seems like a ridiculous dream, so far out of my reach and league, I know I will never have a chance.

I know I was born a sickly baby, and my parents experiences way too many frustrations with me, so maybe I just never was meant to really survive and that's why I can't find a place in life. Or that's the best explanation I can come up with. (No, I'm not religious or of any specific faith, but I guess I believe that some sort of karma/fate system might exist...?)

"How does the canadian psychiatric system work?My long-distance friend is 28 and I've been super worried about him. He's incredibly depressed and he has these emotional spikes where I'm worried that he'll do something rash. I can tell he's in a pretty severe spot. I'm on his speed dial list and I made him put a suicide hotline on his phone as well. I have his local police and hospital on my speed dial as well. 

He had psych treatment all throughout K-12 but since he got out of school he's been unable to get help, assuming that the public healthcare system didn't cover psych and that it'd be way too expensive. He doesn't have job and has been in and out of jobs probably because of this. He may have a few chemical imbalances (obviously I'm not a doctor, I'm just guessing)

"Don’t want to kill myself but feel like I have toMy emotions have been more erratic than usual this week. Once I realized the date, I attempted to remind myself it is probably just my PMDD. My mind doesn’t care what it is. I can’t live like this.

It feels as if most of the people closest to me are against me. I feel like they are often gaslighting me. Maybe my depression and anxiety are making me gaslight myself. I can’t tell when my anxiety is justified. I can’t breathe. The pain in my chest is so tight. One of these days my heart will give out. Will that be a form of suicide?

I am afraid that I’ve unintentionally made many lives worse. I burden those around me with my illness. Sometimes I think they wish I’d just shut up and die. Sometimes I have dreams that they’re murdering me.

I was okay today. Most of my day was wonderful and productive. Coming home again to an empty apartment, alone with my emotions and the negative thoughts of this week is terrifying.

I wrote a letter to some friends the other night. I’ve written many letters that have gone unread. Burned, thrown out, deleted. 

I read a post last night that said “You don’t have to end your life to live a different one.” I think I’ve lived a couple lives by this point though, and I’m afraid this will linger with me through any I may have after.

"Am I being too blunt?(22F)



I’ve known Caroline(27F) for two years. She used to be an addict and in and out of rehab for years. She used to do heroin and drink every day of the week. She works part time and has a trust fund to support her she’s 27 years old. She started smoking weed again at first I didn’t comment but during the summer she quit her job because it was too stressful and doing nothing but smoking. I tried to show my concern then but she shifted blame saying I’m cheap about gas money and don’t know what I’m talking about. That was around my birthday and she ignored me on my birthday. 




Caroline told me she'd not going to AA anymore because it's a ”Christian cult” I just said something like talk to other people about it and see their opinion and she got all defensive and was like ”i don't need others opinions only me and my therapist make that call I've been hundreds of meetings I don't relate I'm not a real alcholic” 

I was just trying to say maybe try different meetings or see what other people think but I didn't disagree like ”oh no you need to go to meetings” because I know that's not always the answer. It's hard to know what to say because sometimes I feel crazy like ”am I being rude” because she says I'm blunt but I feel I try to be sensitive to other people 


now she's all mad and ignoring me. she drank back in July and was like ”that wasn't a relaspe”And saying stuff like she's not a real alcoholic because she didn't black out.


Idk do I sound like I was being too judgemental idk how to handle that? Why is she so mad at me? Am I being too blunt?

"Can I get some game recommendations for PS4? In return I will also give you game recommendations, here you go:

***Hollow Knight -*** Hollow Knight deserves so much love and praise. It's an indie Metroidvania where you play as a cute little bug thing *that has the power to kill literal gods.* You spend the game exploring Hallownest, an ancient, ruined civilization where most of the inhabitants are long-dead, killed by a mysterious infection. The controls in this game are smoother than butter that's been microwaved for 10 seconds, and the combat is extremely satisfying. It's the only game that makes me feel genuinely excited to get demolished in a boss fight.

***Monster Hunter -*** Take one look at the name and take a wild guess what this game is about. Yep! Take your weapon of choice and use it to beat hundreds of cool-looking monsters into a pulp so you can take their dead body and turn it into better weapons and armor to pulverize even bigger, stronger, cooler monsters. Jokes aside tho, Monster Hunter is fun as hell, and GOD is it satisfying when you learn a monster's moveset and then absolutely destroy it. Also, there's a ton of different weapon types to play around with.

***Stardew Valley -*** Time wasting simulator where you take care of a farm, sell things to make insane profits, fight monsters in the local abandoned mine, and date like half the townspeople. It's fun :)

***Genshin Impact -*** It says it's free to play, but it will destroy your non-existent wallet. It's a strange combination of ""gacha game"" and ""anime Breath of the Wild"" that ends up creating a genuinely good game with fun combat and a surprisingly competent main story. ^(This game has no reason being this fun I swear to god.)",0

"Nthe edge was right there and I stepped backI tried to put myself out of my misery a few days ago, but I stopped myself. The problem is that nothing has really changed. My life is static due to an early life crisis. See I had always known I wanted to be a writer since childhood. It was all I ever saw myself doing. When I was in the 12th grade I entered in an essay contest and I overheard the head of the contest talking about my essay. His words were "" this is why he will never be a good writer"" as he said it we made eye contact. I was lost for words and in the moment pretended I didn't hear anything. The next day I was more depressed than I had ever been. I lost faith in my skill and my dream. I couldn't even muster the strength to go to school. 3 years later I'm a drop out with no idea what I want to do with my life and I'm angry at everyone and everything. I try to write and I'm not happy with anything I come up with. Everyone in my life thinks I graduated and am working on getting into community college classes and that I want to be a filmmaker. I have tried to make short films but they are all shit and unwatchable. The truth is that I walk around pretending to be homeless and sleep on park benchs.  I tried to off myself because I truly think I'm going to spend the rest of my life like this, but at the moment of truth I realised I didn't really want to die. The problem now is that I don't know what to do. I can't go back to school, I can't write with confidence, and my films are trash. Its also too late to tell my friends the truth without losing them.

TrappedI was discharged from hospital today from rare medical disorder and now I am looking for a shelter so if anyone knows any shelters in the central midwest it would help me to know. I do not have children. She won't stop screaming at me every reason she hates me. She won't quit saying if I talk she is going to call the police. If anyone can help me please help me. I am going to post this in suicide too. I want to find someone to tell me what she can do to me. She leaked my tire and drained my car battery while i was in hospital.  Thank you.,1
"Why am I losing?I feel like there's no escape from all this toxicity in my life. It has been a factor ever since I could remember; everyone's (family) problems have influenced my path in life and when I make an attempt to get help or find common ground, just something that will make sense. It's like everyone is just brushes me off or tells me to get over it. I have no where to go to find refuge ever since I moved back home to save money in college. It makes me extremely sad. I was already at a disadvantage before I could even start. I always dealt with my rejection long enough, but they really make me want to disappear at this point. I am just so so so so so tired of dealing with all these problems. I don't understand why everyone is depending on me to make their lives better and solve their social problems when I am only 19 years old. I don't even have a name for myself, and I'm just trying to figure myself out, and when I want help or just a simple conversation, everybody is so quick to shut me up or like give me money so I can feel better about something. I never ask for anything except a piece of your time, a simple conversation, a moment to CONNECT with someone because I'm an only child and everyone seem so preoccupied when I was younger, and now I'm older so why is it so hard? And my mother addiction to drugs only makes it worse because she becomes very mentally and emotionally abusive that tears me down in such innocent situations, so I developped a a negative traits. I don't know what to do. I am sad. I am hurt.",1
"I’m so tired of hearing words like privilege Privileged, racist, incel, misogynist, homophobe, transphobe, sexist, etc. I know they have actual meaning but nowadays I hear them used for just the stupidest of reasons. They are so overused and it seriously gets annoying.

And yes I know there will be that one guy in the comments who uses all these words in a sentence. So haha in advance.",0

"Thought I Was Getting BetterHave been suicidal for years now. Almost went through with it this year but went to a mental hospital instead. For a while everything seemed to be looking up. Tossed out my note even.

Now it feels like I'm falling back in. Committed self harm for the first time in years last night and keep thinking how much better off this world would be if I weren't in it. I'm a burden to my friends and family and don't think I can handle letting them down more. I know suicide would be rough on them but long term I think theyd be better without me. 

I dont know. I'm so tired of feeling like this. Like, am I ever going to be happy, or is this it?

"Guys, DONT DRINK COFFEE AND GATORADE It tastes terrible and you will regret it.
I was just minding my own business and left some coffee on a table that I promptly forget about. I felt thirsty a little while later so I got some blue Gatorade. While drinking said gatorade, I realised I had not finished the coffee so I started to drink it, my whole perspective on life has changed and my day was ruined before it even started because of the rank mixture of drinks that ended up in my godforsaken mouth.",0
"Alcohol PoisoningI've attempted suicide multiple times in the past, but I've obviously messed all those up.  After doing research, I've decided to give acute alcohol poisoning a go.

"How I feel every dayEvery day I wake up, no matter how much faith I have, how hard I work, how much I pray, I say to myself, how the fuck do I get through another day without committing suicide? I did my best, and received nothing I desired in return. I long for someone I can never be with, and I hate whichever entity is in charge or was in charge of this planet. I was faithful, I worked hard, all for nothing. I don't want anything I can't have. I don't have any desire to work, yet I have to work or go homeless. I see the world around me, and it's becoming more and more uneven. if I died tomorrow, I would be happy. At least Jesus got to die after he was killed. I didn't get to die after I was killed, I am forced to keep living for nothing that I want. Toss me another woman I have no feelings for, and then punish me for not desiring her. Keep doing it, life is so predictable, such bullshit. I've been checked out, I've been done for a long time. I can never get her back. It's like God recognizes none of my feelings, any of the deeply wounding pain I feel and have felt throughout my entire life, and to hell with you. You never helped me, and you never could. You're an asshole for keeping me alive.",1

"It's not enough to just be fat and lonely, but now I have to be diagnosed with oral cancer. Fuck.While all of my close friends are comfy with their girlfriends and fiancees, I'm just sitting here kicking it until I die. I don't necessarily want to die, but the fact that I just got diagnosed with cancer really doesn't help.

Nothing turned out the way I wanted it to. I was supposed to graduate college, get a good job and have some girl fall in love with me. Instead, I dropped out because of crippling depression after my grandfather (my father figure) died, got scrap jobs for the last five years and now....well, now...I have fucking cancer.

If there is a God, this is him giving me the stone cold stunner. I'm down for the count. If I do survive, my life won't even be worth it. Instead, I'd love to just try and start again. It doesn't happen this way, but fuck. It makes me sick that some of the people I know that don't deserve shit are taking trips to fucking Cabo three times a year and I'm scrapping for $200 in a good week.

Should I make a note or just leave my parents feeling guilty for the rest of their lives?

EDIT: I realise that it sounds like I'm blaming my parents. I'm not, but they just don't understand me at all. I've tried to explain my problems to them to get help and they never took me seriously.",1

Forever asleep

His heart buried deep

I've been in treatment for a long time and I don't know how to stop seeing my psychiatrist.  I've had intense suicidal urges and have been hospitalized twice.  Once after I woke up after the po*** chlor*** I injected missed the vein in my upper thigh.  It burned when I injected it and I just thought I was going to die.  Needless to say, I didn't.  I've always been honest with my doctor, but I didn't think that she was going to place me in the psych unit.  She asked me to admit myself or she will call the police to pick me up.  I promised her that I would, but I sat in the parking lot of the hospital.  I could not do it.  I knew what was going to happen to me.  I've been placed on a 72hr hold once before.  My doctor must have called the hospital because a guard found me in the lot.  I want to forget the hospital, but I have thoughts of this that don't go away.  I have multiple health problems.  I was told that I would live with this the rest of my life.  This isn't the life I wanted.  Why can't they just let me go?  Now I have daily checkins with my doctor.  I don't think I can keep doing this.  I wished that I never told my doctor what I've done.  I know my doctor really cares and this makes this even harder.

Why is the sun a creature of habit” When she was about to ask her friend to get the door, she saw the guy she once loved but always doubted if he would still love her all these years later and yet he was standing in front of her. He used sign language to tell her “I’ve spent a year's time learning sign language, looked through all the forests, people, cities, and fields just to let you know that I’ve not forgotten our promise. Let me have the chance to be your voice” and with that he put the ring back on her finger just like he did many years ago, it was as if her cold iron heart had melted away and she wondered “is it still possible for him to love her like this?” So she signed “are you willing to take the risk of being with me, it wouldn’t be the easiest task and there’s always others ?” He replied with “The bigger the risk, the greater the reward and there will never be another like you” and for the first time in years she smiled.",0

What if I actually went through with it? Would I be brave enough? Would fear stop me? Would I actually do it? Who would find my body? Who would care? Will it impact anyone else's life dramatically, or just a temporary sadness? What would be my last thought? Is this really it? Complete nothingness after this? Or is it some trippy afterlife/rebirth process? 

I think it was as young as 8th grade when I realized I could potentially kill myself. I noticed when I would read/hear stories of other suicides. I'd feel a connection to them, like a mirror. While everyone else either mocked it or viewed it as the worst possible thing, I viewed it as ""hmmm, I wonder how many thoughts we had in common? They kinda looked like me...had the same interests as me...I feel like I could've been their friend"". I always felt like saying to them "" *Hey... I get it...*""

I don't know. I'm not  gonna kill myself anytime soon (at least I don't think so), so sorry if this is a misuse of this sub. But I always come back...I always come back to that eerie gut feeling that suicide really is the way I'm gonna go. I can't shake it, it doesn't really even bother me much anymore. It's now more of a curiosity/wonder what will trigger it type of thinking.

It's been a weird night. I'm gonna go to sleep. I hope whoever is reading this can relate somehow. I'm not sure why that would matter, but it'd make me feel less alone.",1

I'm going to work in this grocery store until I die.

It's a lie that I'm fine. That I'm just tired. I don't want the people around me to worry. It's not appropriate to talk about this during working hours, I don't have the right relationship with my parents to ask them for help, and I never hang out with anyone. So I bottle up my self-hatred, my anxiety, my suicidal ideation until it comes out in posts like this.

It's a lie that I'm so fucking happy all the time. When I'm around my coworkers, I tell jokes. I smile and shit like that. They like me, at least to my face. But the second I'm alone, all I can think about is all the ways I've fucked up, whether or not other people see them as fuck-ups (and suicide, of course). Video games make me feel... hallow, I guess. My projects die off as I become less motivated to do anything.

It's no effort to lie anymore. It just happens; people think I'm happy. I don't want to keep lying though, since I don't know how long posts like this can put off my inevitable first attempt.

I don't want to keep lying. I don't want to keep living with my parents. I don't want to keep working at a grocery store in the middle of nowhere. I don't want be alone. I don't want to keep hating everything I say, am, and do. But the only way out I see is to kill myself.

I treat my family and my closest friends like shit and I cant help myself ignoring them and saying things i dont want to and it hurts me more than it hurts them..

"Fuck racists and sexists This has probably been said before, but racists and sexists have absolutely no place in this world. I will never understand why people are treated differently just because they are a different gender or that the amount of melatonin in their skin is different. It just makes no sense. They are both cliche, old ideals that, for SOME REASON, people still like to stick to.

Sexism, against anyone, is horrible. It doesn't matter who the target is. It's fucking horrible. Telling a girl to go to the kitchen because that's so-called ""where she belongs"" is so fucking old and there's no reason it should still be a thing. 

However, women are not the only victims of sexism. Many men face the same problem everyday as well. Just because one man does something wrong, it doesn't mean the entire gender is some sort of evil spirit that only exist to catcall women and other bullshit like that. **Some of us may do that, but 99% of us are not like that.** 

Same thing goes with racism. It's dumb, hurtful, and way past its time. Just because someone has a darker skin tone than you it doesn't mean that they should be treated differently. Before telling someone to ""go back to their own country"" just remember where your ancestors came from. Your ancestors probably weren't from America either. How do you think that makes them feel?

"Lost on what to doI made some really huge mistakes recently. Ones that completely ruined me and the relationship I was in. I hurt the one person who meant the world to me, I became a person I swore I never would. I’ve spent the last week staring at pills I have in my vanity, wondering how many I could take before I would just go. Looking  at razor and wanting to cut myself to feel a different pain, to watch the blood pour out until I went. I’ve attempted before, in other ways, but it’s been a really long time. I reached out... but this time, I know I probably won’t do any, but the desire is there, it’s really strong. I’ve been bashed, belittled, I deserve it. I feel like I deserve to be gone, because I became someone I swore I never would.... so maybe I am that person, and if I am then I would much rather be dead. His life would be better with me gone for good, others life would be better with me gone.... I feel like it’s the only real answer left, I’ve tried positive talk, reaching out, staying busy, beating myself up, letting others talk down to me.... I’ve tried what I feel like is everything, suicide just keeps sounding better and better. Like I have nothing else. Like I deserve it.",1
"Having a reason to stay alive hurts really bad sometimesThis might be kinda a long post so apologies in advance. I just really don’t know what I’m feeling right now or how to describe it.

I feel like I’ve been *this* close to doing it for a really long time. Actively planning my death gave me the most determination I can remember having. I was honestly weirdly proud of my work, that I knew that this would almost certainly kill me, without too much discomfort, etc. Hell, I wrote a script to send out suicide note emails to people on a time delay that I could cancel if I backed out or fucked up, so nobody could try to save me or whatever. But, it’s kinda all done. I honestly can’t think of anything that’s reasonably likely to happen that would keep me from dying. I have everything I need except one bit that I’m waiting to buy to prevent myself from doing it on impulse. The issue is that one of those emails I need to send is to someone I don’t think I know how to say goodbye to.

So, my partner is an absolutely amazing human being and I really love them. They also happen to be the only person I actually think would care if I died. I really don’t want to let them down. Also I know that they’re also not doing great on the will to live front either, and so I don’t know if this is an arrogant assumption but I just really don’t want this to turn into them also doing it when I go. They need to be ok, and I don’t know how to ensure that. But I really need to figure it out. 

I know it’s a bit dumb to complain about having a reason to live when there’s so many people here who feel they don’t have any, so I’m sorry about that. And I know it probably makes me a pretty shit person to still really want to go through with it even knowing what it could do to one of the few truly kind people on this planet. I just hate that this is going to end up hurting people, since avoiding that was pretty much the whole reason for doing it in the first place. I don’t know how to make this situation better.",1

"What do red roses mean? So, first things first. As I am quite an introvert, I never was able to grasp many social 'conventions'.

About 2 years ago, when I was throwing a party for my 16th birthday (nothing big, I always only invite a handful of friends, we go on some activity (this time it was an escape room) and then we'll return for games, gifts and cake) a friend, a very good friend that I knew since I was 11 or 12, who happens to be a girl, gifted me a single red rose. The 'main' present was also great, it was a 30€ gift card for a comic book store if I remember correctly. 

Because the internet gave me conflicting answers, I never knew what that meant. And I sure as hell was not going to ask anybody about that. Until yesterday. I asked my mom, who told me that the meaning of a rose depends on its color. A white rose means apology, a pink rose means friendship and a red rose means love. 

I was baffled. If that's really true, I was missing signs that a smart, funny and ngl quite good looking girl was hitting on me. As I havn't been in a lot of relationships it wouldn't surprise me to be oblivious in the ways of love. 

A few months before my birthday, however, she switched schools and the introvert that I am, we lost contact at some point.

I am still confused and a little angry about myself. I feel dumb and I thought that I might as well ask Reddit. I don't know whether I should go and try to get to the bottom of this, or whether I am overthinking this.

Oh yeah, I should ask a question at this point. It's basically the question in the title.",0

I meet a girl (or guy) who'll sleep with me have a couple of kids be broke for the rest of my life kids grow to resent me I've become an alcoholic.this is the least likely and happiest choice. 2.

Meds never work bc the docs aren’t asking me anything and I never had courage to tell them because they never seem to care. Years ago I finally called out for help. I called my mom and told her I was self harming and wanted to die etc. you know what she said. “I’ve done that (self harm) before. You’re fine. You don’t need help.”  (HA my mom also said that when I was bulimic too.) So since then I just try to shove it down. So fast forward I told my boyfriend (also child’s father) that I’m sick. He constantly sees me crying, upset, knows I have childhood trauma (though he doesn’t know it all.  it’s gotten a lot worse after having a child. I used to be able to deal.) I tell him I need help. I need a therapist etc. he says “what do you want me to do? I don’t know how that works. Idk how to find you a doctor. Do it for yourself.” (FYI He has no idea how to talk to someone with mental illness.) anyway the two people I’ve cried out to before wanting to really kill myself are too are stupid.

Now I just want to die. I am an angry, bitter shell of a human being. I am a burden to everyone who cares about me because I refuse to help myself. I see no point, because I can't change the past, and I can't change the fact that I am me. I can't live with it either.

I have been having suicidal thoughts for a few weeks now. The gap that separates thoughts from action is big and scary, but step by step I feel like I am beginning to narrow it. It feels like just a matter of time before I finally decide to swim out as far as I can, and then it can all be over.",1

"I'm fucked Until quite recently I was the type of kid who never did homework, never studied for tests, but still somehow managed to get A's and B+'s. This means that I never learned how to fucking study. 

Next week I have my mock IGCSE exams, which usually aren't that important, just to practice for the real exams, but with due to the virus, the mock exams might become my end of year score. 

I don't know how to study, and my parents try to help, but really they can't, as their not used to how we're taught things at school (i live outside of my home country and go to an international school).

Does anyone have any tips on how to at least get the basics down for the tests next week?",0

"a little rantSo I’m using a throwaway for obvious reasons. I haven’t told anyone this.
I’ve been intensely depressed lately, it hurts physically to be alive- i wake up and go to sleep crying. Anyway so yesterday I went to drink on the park with some friends and I drank far too much, hoping it would make me happy or numb. It did for a bit but on the way home, I got off the train in the middle of nowhere, sat in a park and had a mental breakdown. I mean, properly sobbing- i called Samaritans hoping they’d be able to tell me why i’m suicidal even when i’m happy, but they were utterly useless and only responded with “mmm...mmm...that must be hard.” So i hung up and cried for an hour or so on the random park before heading back to the train station and god i wanted to chuck myself over the tracks so badly. So badly. I was too pussy to do it though. I got on the train and cried all the way home and couldn’t think about anything other than killing myself. 
Yeah. I haven’t told anyone that- nobody knows the extent of my depression. Why am i suicidal even when i’m happy, Reddit?",1
"Why can't I be happy?I'm suicidal, that's just a fact. I idolize the idea of it, I think I would be gone in an instant if I didn't have people around me holding me down.

 I have an illness that causes massive gut pain, permanently disfigured me (huge scar lines all over including crotch, looks like inflammed herpes), I've been mentally unstable because of the meds I take and my doctors still don't know what the hell is wrong. 5 years of non stop pain, and I'm only 21, now on methadone/norco/oxy to try and function. 

My live in girlfriend, who does truly love me, doesn't have sex with me anymore because she stopped enjoying it. She just has no libido because we couldn't figure out how to make her finish and she got bored. I can't masterbate either because my meds make me not feel orgasms anymore. Life has been one kick to the balls after another. I'm not going to see 30 if this is what it's going to be like, I can't take it, no good food or sex or happiness or joy. Emptiness. So I sit, and wait until my girlfriend leaves for class, then I sob at home because I'm too doped up to do anything worth while (instead of being in so much pain I can't do anything...), and fantasize about how to end it and when. Why can't I just be normal? Why can't I just be happy? Why do I have to live like this? Fucking IBD, you have ruined my life, my body, and my mind. I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.",1

"I've been putting this off for too long, the time is nowTonight is the night ladies and gentlemen.

At 02:00 PST (UTC-8) I will begin my journey to my final destination, a 30 minute walk to a nearby community garden full of beautifully colored fall trees. It is there where I take my own life and finally end this cycle of emptiness.

I skipped class, but managed to make it through work. I've been taking combos of pills all day to make myself less anxious, but the feeling is still there, the feeling that I don't really want to die, I just want this to end. I've been chain smoking cigarettes and putting them out on my arms to prepare for what is coming next.

Once I arrive at my destination I plan on notifying emergency services of a suicide upon which I will commence my ultimate journey into the nether.

I would have done this last night, but I smoked a little too much cannabis and ended up passing out. and waking up long after my ""deadline"" had past.

Right now I'm preparing my final meal, seared gnocchi with a garlic meat sauce. I plan on enjoying this with some herbal tea and a few short docus on YT to pass the time.

I tried so hard to be that guy she met, To be better than that. To move forward not just for her but for me so I could be happy, I was changing and challenging myself at every end. I finally felt like I could cover all my promises and much more.  I just wasn't good enough for her anymore.

I've been in /depression, /sw with another username and you guys really kept me at bay these past couple months, via skype, sms, pm. I'm grateful to a lot of you. Saw a lot of other people who also suffer, really changes the perspective.

I (21F) don't live with him but I want to do anything I can to help him, what do you guys suggest? Just as the title says, my brother is having a lot of anxiety and disdain for the current schooling situation, which is online only right now. He's very worried he won't be able to get good grades while schooling from home because it's harder for him to focus, and this is his junior year so grades are important this year.Do you guys have any advice, for either me or my brother?

"Suicidal without being depressed?Is it possible to be suicidal without being depressed? For about a year now I've had this feeling inside that everything would be better if I was dead. Most of the time I just feel like a load to those around me and I can't really help it because I'm not really good at amything and usually end fucking things up. I get to thinking that if I died right now, I don't think anyone besides my mom would care and I'd be doing her a favor in the long run. 

All that being said, I don't think I'm depressed. I can see the beauty in life and I would really love to travel. I can still laugh, joke, smile, feel good. I have a couple of friends that suffer depression and I really can't compare myself to them. I still go out, I have a normal social life, and nobody not even my closest friends would be able to tell that this is how I feel. 

I don't think I'd ever attempt to commit suicide but it's just the thought of doing it feels so tempting. I can't really trust this to anyone, my mom would freak out and I don't think she'd be of any help, and I don't want to worry or shock my friends, and most of all I don't want people to think I'm doing it for attention.",1

"Reasons I deserve to dieI keep going over these reasons that I deserve to die...
1. Every friend/partner I have ever known has left me, most hate me.
2. People tell me I'm rude and manipulative but I don't know how to stop.
3. I'm a leech on people, they buy things for me and half of it I don't even use.
4. Society doesn't need another mentally ill faggot like me... 
5. Most people just hate me based on my being pansexual and possibly transgender and if I live in a world where I can't be myself then I just shouldn't be in that world.
6. I know that every moment of my happiness is just an illusion, every time I meet a new friend I feel great but then it always turns out bad because I'm stupid.
7. I already do stuff that will kill me slowly, so why not spare the excess food and such for someone who actually needs it?
8. I want to die, and I think about it constantly. 
9. No one legitimately cares about me, hence no friends and no one wanting to put up with me being depressed or even just me in general. ",1
"i have no reason to be this depressedthere is virtually nothing wrong with my life, at least not enough to be this depressed about. i’ve definitely been through some rough shit in my life but in the last 6 months or so things have been relatively good. i’ve been taking zoloft for depression and OCD for years now. took prozac and wellbutrin xl before that. all the sudden this summer my zoloft stopped working. i became massively depressed — sleeping all the time, no interest in anything, crying periodically. we changed my dose and i got a lot better. now things are bad again and have been for a month at least. i constantly think about killing myself, how i do not want to be here going through the mundane over and over until something inevitably bad happens some day. how every good and happy and exciting moment is fleeting. and how i am so disappointed in myself, my personality, my body, everything about myself — and wanting to die makes me feel even more guilt and shame, like i know people have it worse off than me, which only makes it worse. 

i have been putting dying off for weeks. the holidays, work, things that i knew i needed to do. but i know that i can do it any time, and i have enough pills to do it, and they are constantly taunting me from my medicine cabinet. i feel like simultaneously a coward and a burden, like i will destroy the people around me if i go through with suicide and like i will make their lives worse if i stay. 

i don’t know why i’m posting here. i can’t really share the extent of my feelings with anyone close to me i guess, despite how good they are to me. i don’t deserve it. they deserve better.",1

I think I’ve been living with an undiagnosed mental illness for the whole of this year, but don’t have the resources to get help for it, so it’s just getting worse every day. I feel like I’m at a point in my life where I should be growing, moving on to new things, getting more mature- but I’m just stuck where I am, hopelessly running in place. I finished my AA in community college in fall, but I ended up having to take a semester off in hopes of getting control of my mental health, working to save up money, and to decide what major/career I want to go for/ what university to attend/ where to move. But now the semester has passed and I’ll have to wait until fall because I haven’t accomplished any of the things  I needed to. So now I’m stuck here, 21 years old, still living with my parents, working 32 hrs/wk, with no idea where to go from here and very little hope of ever getting better. Happy new year, I guess.",1

"I started the clock, and all I hear is ticking.I said I'd give it some time. I said I'd try everything to get better physically, even if it involved extreme pain. I let them shove needles longer than my hand into my spine and burn off my nerve endings. I let them hold me down while I screamed, and they didn't care. I let people shove needles in my neck and back over 100 times this year. I let a surgeon slice open my throat and fill it with metal. I said I'd try more psych meds and counseling. I said I'd try to hold on. 

And I did. I waited. I thought about it. I got help. I experimented. I waited some more. I tried some more. I took more medications. I saw more doctors for my health problems. 

I'm broke from medical costs. I've been berated by so many doctors and endured so many painful medical procedures. I said I'd wait until another round of appointments this week, hope someone had...not answers, but a reason to wait. Some vestigage of hope. 

I walk into my neurologist's, scared, in so much pain, and she yelled at me. She yelled at me so loud the receptionist in the lobby heard it and apologized. They sent me away, and I've just been crying for hours, and hours. 

If she doesn't cancel on me, I see my psychiatrist in the morning. She's kind, and really wants to help. 

But she can only do so much. It's not her fault my body's broken and half of my doctors are somewhere between callous and abusive. 

Hope's on pause, but the clock has started. A few days, a few weeks maybe. That's all I have left in me. I want so badly just to do it tonight, but I want to give my psychiatrist one more chance; not as an ultimam--she can only do so much, and I'm essentially a lost cause, but maybe if nothing else, I want to thank her for being the only one who's really tried to get me through this. 

I feel guilty, but I can't do this anymore. ",1

My brain keeps fixating on an event from my late teen years I think 17/19 and I’m worried what it means about me and my life. In a moment of stupidity I encouraged the family dog to lick me down there, it didn’t last long a couple of seconds maybe I don’t know , but the fact I was capable of doing that of thinking for a split second that’s that was ok or even an option mortifies me. I am terrified it makes me a monster akin to people who abuse and molest and take advantage of the weak and innocent , it makes me feel as though I don’t deserve to live and suicide constantly rattled around my head as my only release.

I hate that I ruined my life story. That I can never look back fondly on my past self because she was capable of this thing that mortifies me. I wish with all my being I could take it back I really do. I worry that I’ll never find love because I feel I don’t deserve it and I worry I will never be able to enjoy sex because any time I do anything enjoyable that is related to sex by myself or with a partner (there’s only been one) I am reminded of my worst action it plays constantly in my head and ruins everything.

"I think i'm losing the fightI'm depressed, anxious and alone. I'm fighting this fight for about 10 years now. I was so confident as a kid, but my parents destroyed me. For every mistake, no matter how small, i would get beaten. Didn't brush my teeth, here comes the belt. It fucked me up. Today the thought of making a mistake makes me wanna crawl into bed. Didn't pass an exam? I feel worthless and anxious. Also i'm ashamed of my self. As a teen, the beatings got replaced by psychological torture. My parents would tell me i'm lazy, worthless and that i never would achieve anything. At some point i turned to food and barely left my room. I gained a lot of weight which i still carry around. Now not only my parents fucked me up, but there also was bullying in school. The once confident kid turned into a stuttering teen. I don't know, i could continue to ramble on, but i guess you got the point.

Fast forward to now. Additional to all mentioned problems i now also have trust issues and fear of being abandoned by my friends. I feel like i mean nothing to them. I'm all alone. Daily life alone is hard enough. But right now it's nearly unbearable. I have to move cities because of uni. And the housing market seems to be just like a dating market nowadays. I'm trying to find a commune, so i can live with 2-3 other students together. Currently i'm living alone and it's not good for me. I wrote to several people who offered a commune in the new city. Usually you have to write something about yourself and send them a pic. Well i didn't get a single answer yet and its killing me. I feel like i'm worthless to other people. Who wants to live with a fat dude. No one. Not even my friend who got accepted to the same uni. We were planning to get a flat together, but she started searching by herself without telling me and now she already found something. I honestly don't know if i want to continue fighting.

"Feeling Really Low. Always Have.I've always had very little motivation, even as a kid. I don't know if it was my environment, genetics or both. As I've grown up, I've recognized it in my dad as well. We are both lazy. He's barely making is financially, my mom is the only reason he has a roof over his head and she doesn't even live in the same state. 

However, what really gets me down is thinking that I never asked to be born but I'm expected to work hard to survive. This makes me want to give up. Nothing interests me career wise. I've always been horrible in school, my family is broken and I hate relying on people. 

I wish I was never born. I wish I had the strength to just give up on life just like I've given up on everything else. It's just too difficult for me. It's something I never signed up for.

I can't seem to connect with anyone and it's horrible.  Any friends I make are gone again within a few months, and it always seems to be me doing the legwork.  The idea of a girlfriend at this point is laughable for several reasons.  My life just lacks direction, and is very lonely.  I have the social skills of a grilled sandwich, and not even a tasty one.
    
I've tried to fix these things.  I've done lots of volunteer work, where I met some people, who I now don't ever speak to.  Tried to get out to places more, but that hasn't worked.  I'm at a loss of what to do really.  I'd like to travel somewhere, but I'm broke, and I'm pretty certain I'd just come back to being in the exact same situation again.
    
I'm not completely ignorant of any positives in my life, it's just that they're so horrible outweighed by negatives, some of them that I can't do anything about.

I suppose you could say I have suicidal thoughts a lot, lately especially...but then it's something I'd never go through with, I can't see it ever happening (so goes the usual ""I don't know if I should be posting this here, etc"").

"2.0Have posted here before a few months back when in the midst of University stress.

Fast forward about 5 months and I am back feeling ... catastrophic? Unstable? Unbearable? 

I'm unemployed and searching for work [I haven't been able to find any volunteer things that will take me either]; had to move out of a previous share house because of problems and have moved into a new house that I can't really afford, but was my only option as I couldn't find somewhere else being unemployed; and am having major problems in my personal life with friendships/relationships. 

I'm insanely self critical and I think I have been acting in a self-destructive way to try to overcome that... I feel like I am in a cycle of doing things that I think will make me feel good at the time but ultimately I know that it will hurt me in the end. 

I am just sick of feeling anxious, terrible about myself, upset that I have hurt others, like a bad person and unable to cope. I have hours on end to think about these things every day as I have nothing else to do besides look at jobs that I know I will be unable to get, or try to satiate myself with distractions (but ultimately, they cost money). I have been seeing a psychologist on and off for about two years, but I am reluctant to go back for a few reasons (even though a friend has suggested this to me): it's a bit unaffordable for me right now, I don't feel comfortable talking to them about relationship issues for fear of judgement (I'm totally fucked up lol) and I've been in therapy since I was about 15, I'm now 21, and I sort of ... don't know if I will ever be able to get help. I feel like I see the world differently and that I am not ""normal"", and perhaps I should just admit to myself that I am not a good person and just accept fate the way it is.

I have told my psychologist before that I have experienced thoughts of suicide, but they are mainly just a form of escapism. The feelings I have been having recently are more than that - I feel unbearable pain and I don't know how to stop it. There seems no answer, but I guess suicide appears as though it is the only way to be able to alleviate my shame, guilt and resolve my financial/personal/employment problems. ",1

"We need to fix Schools- General Argument 1; Schools inefficiently utilize time and resources.  

I'll go into detail in the following days, for today I’m going to be stating my generalized opinion. We know the routine. Get up, get ready, go to school, go home, do homework. After that, the schedule deviates to the individual. The part of our day where we all have a common routine is put bluntly, horrible. We go to school and we sit in classes to learn things, then we go home and do assignments about what we learned in class. Wait wait wait, hold up a second. So school gonna drag my ass out of bed unreasonably early five days a week, drag my ass to a place equipped for education, and then sit on my ass doing nothing but taking notes and listening for several hours. Then you're gonna tell me that school is going to send us home, a pace not equipped for education, to do the work that I could have done during the several hours of lectures I just had to listen to? I take that personally. Confused? Let me simplify. We have to spend part of our day at school, but instead of doing the work intended to be done at school, we have to listen to people tell us how to do that work and then we have to spend our own time doing it at home. I don’t know about you, but I think that's some pretty bullshit way to spend your youth. I’m young and healthy, I want to run, to party, to explore and do the things I may never again do once my youth leaves me. But the reality is that here I am, stuck at my desk doing pointless, abusive busywork.

A lot of us are students and can  agree with firsthand experience that their respective education systems are flawed. We're all aware of the issue, it’s time we come together to solve it.",0

"What is wrong with me?I have been lost for years
For some reason ever since i was little i wanted to be a girl. I grew up playing bratz dolls and dress up until i was 16 then my dad told me to stop being a ""fag"" and always tried to get me to do ""guy"" things that i have no interest in. I just want to go shopping and drink a venti with the girls. I could go on and on about more examples. Idk why i feel this way. I was going to try and start hrt but im too scared. I dont understand. I wanted it so bad and the opportunity presented itself but i scared away. I dont know how i would even explain it to my family. I cant even explain it to myself. Due to this i have had years of suicidal thoughts and alienate myself from everyone around me. I tried to make it obvious sometimes just to talk but nobody seems to notice and bitch about their feelings and never ask how i feel. Nobody cares about me. I dont even care about myself but im too scared to commit suicide either. I dont think i will ever be able to actually transition. Even if i transitioned would that fix all my problems and suicidal thoughts. I dont know. Im sure id be happier but i dont want to regret it. I hate myself and the way i look and i dont know why. But when i crossdress i feel great and so pretty and on top of the world. I feel like im trapped in my current situation. Im only 20 and dont want to regret not doing it while im this age but im still confused on if their is a deeper source of pain giving me these thoughts and i dont actually want to become a female but instead i want to just to mend mental issues. I dont know why my brain is like this. I dont even feel like going on anymore. This seems to be a never ending fight and the prize is an unachievable happiness. I have never felt true happiness and i dont understand why im full of so much pain. ",1

"I never got to be a teenager.Hey everyone, hope your night has been better than mine. I've been lying in bed for about 4 hours now trying to think of a reason to move but I just cant find one. I'm 20 years old and I disgust myself. I can't get a job and my parents pay for my apartment and my college. They think that I have a plan to use my major and that I'm having the time of my life at this school but the truth is I'm completely lost and alone. My grades are fine but I'm not on track to graduate or get any internships (a death sentence in todays economy). I also spend every night locked in my room alone listening to my roommates and neighbors party. 

In a year or so I'm going to have to take care of myself completely: get a job I hate and be even more isolated than I am now. I don't want that. I want to be a teenager again. I spent my teens being a nerdy straight edge loser. I never went to dances in high school, never asked out any of my crushes, never went on a spring break, never got drunk in college, never rushed a fraternity, never made friends in the dorms, never got to experience young love.

 I missed out on so many parties, events and memories during the most important decade of my life and its left me to be an emotionally stunted shell. I have nothing to look forward to except work and loneliness because all of the best things in life passed me by. Whenever I remember all the old young adult stories I read in middle school I can barely believe that I'm actually older than all of those characters. I feel like a child, scared and helpless. I'm weak, unattractive to women and made fun of by guys. Its all my fault for letting my teens escape unchallenged. I'm soft, lazy and completely outmached by the amazing, beautiful and motivated people that surround me.

 If I had just done things differently for the last few years I probably could have had everything I want: friends , sex, career prospects; but instead I'm burning away my parents life savings to sit and cry alone on a squeaky bed. I dont want to live this life anymore; I just want to go back, I just want to make things right. ",1

"Please help me finally make a decisionDear friends,

I am not sure if this kind of post breaks the subreddit rules and I apologize profoundly if it does. I am a 21 year old male who is unsure of everything. I am so tired of always doubting myself. I can not even finally decide to kill myself. All my life I have worked towards my goals and I usually almost achieve them. I say almost because every fucking time something happens that it out of my control and my dreams are crushed right before me. I got admitted to my dream school for undergrad but because of a revolution in my home country, I couldn’t attend. Now I got into my dream PhD programs, but because of Corona and the shitiness of my home country I will probably be drafted and will not be able to achieve this goal too. All this along, I did not have friends(every single one of them betrayed me when I needed them most) and the only thing keeping me were my goals. 

I want to die but I do not want to hurt those around me. I am sick and tired of everything, but do not want to hurt my parents. 

How can I stage my suicide to look like an accident? Or what can I do?

"Been contemplating doing it for two months, feeling really awful right nowI'm not going to delve in to back story, but if you care you can look at my post history.

Basically, I drove away a girl I was seeing because I semi-threatened her with suicide (not really, I just called her a few times telling her I was suicidal). She said I've made her really uncomfortable and told me to stop contact her, but I kept contacting her. I've since stopped, there's no point continuing that. I feel disgusted at myself and the whole situation. It's vile and has fucked up my view on women and relationships.

I don't have a job, at least not a proper one (I'm an Uber driver). I have a Bachelor's degree in Arts, but my full time job prospects look pretty grim. I'm scared of entering the job market and feel like a child in this sense.

I have friends, but they don't really reach out to me. I've tried reaching out to them and they can only help so much. I understand this.

I spend a lot of time sleeping now, or just laying in bed thinking about it. I'm not eating properly. I feel like shit. Sometimes I can see why suicide is not the way, that there is hope for me to change my life around and become the person I used to be or someone even better. But most of the time I'm just drowning in my own sadness. Every day is lonely. Every day I think about everyone else going about doing their job while I just sit at home reading this and other subreddits like it. It's a fucking sad existence. I don't think I really, truly want to kill myself, I just don't want this life I currently have. I think a lot of you could relate if you read just these last few sentences.

while my shirt was being changed this raggedy old guy just stood by my bed and watched me (there were no rooms, just one large room w lots n lots of beds - so no privacy).
i felt so disgusting through and through.

so now it feels weird to be here and not there. since those 3 years my mom died and im not over it. i feel stifled and hindered and i see all my high school friends flourish and grow and love and be loved by their parents whereas i remember my last interaction w my mom was hostile. 

when i was 14/15 i thought god was going to kill me himself bc i wasnt meant to be here. like by the time id be 25 id be gone. i still have a few years to go but i feel ive hit my midlife (crisis. several crises. ) mark. i know ill do it i just dont know when.

"I don't think I can commit to it but I am constantly thinking about itSo ever since I started college I began falling behind in pretty much all aspects of my life. I wasn't making any friends and I was doing poorly in all my classes (never formed a study habit). It continued for a year or two and I was hiding my grades from my parents. It got bad enough that I eventually had to tell them and I medically withdrew and transferred closer to home. I thought a fresh start could help and not having the burden of those lies would allow me to get on track. Now I'm another year in and I'm doing it again. I don't want to kill myself but I do feel that dying wouldn't be too bad. I know that school and all that isn't anything to kill yourself over and it isn't the end of the world but I have no motivation.

I'm starting to give up on college and know that the only way for me to be successful is to focus on these creative endeavors and make something out of it.

"So, I want to die but if I kill myself and there is an afterlife...I won't be able to kill myself in the afterlife.So given that there is a chance there is something after this life (undecided here), let's weigh out the options.
1. Reincarnation-I sure as hell don't want to come back to this earth! But if I do, I suppose I could commit suicide again, but then I'd just come back to earth again and the cycle would keep repeating
2. Heaven-Even if heaven is ""great,"" it involves eternity, which let's be real-I don't want to live forever. I highly doubt I can commit suicide in heaven
3. Hell-There are many definitions as to what this can be, ranging from separation from God to fire and brimstone to merely the grave...but let's assume some sort of eternal torture, taking the worst case scenario....I highly doubt one can commit suicide in hell

And there are many versions of heavens, hells, what happens when we reincarnate, and plenty of other afterlife ""options,"" but the above are the main ones people argue these days. 
And that's why I can't kill myself. Because there is a chance that there is an afterlife, and there is a chance the afterlife sucks more than this life and there will be no escape..

"At The End of My RopeI am 17 years old. Graduated high school a year early, now work a part time job with no aspirations of going back to school. I have struggled with my sexuality and gender but am overall comfortable with it, it doesn’t source any distress. Been diagnosed with everything under the sun, but my most current diagnosis is chronic depression, BPD, and ADHD. The past two weeks, I’ve spent every day fixated on suicide. I’ve never felt this suicidal in my life. Quarantine hasn’t left me in the greatest mental space, but getting out of school and being able to hang out with friends more has made things easier.
A month ago, I broke up with my boyfriend of six months because my mental health was so bad that it was detrimental to our relationship. The past two days, we hung out with friends and one on one. Today was just a bad depression day, and I couldn’t get out of bed. Even for him. He said the day was ruined and took me home. Then when I didn’t wanna talk in the car, he said I was acting mean. The chance of being able to function in a relationship with him again was really the last thing keeping me from ending it all. Now I have fucked it up by being depressed.
I’m getting my license and moving out from my shitty home situation next month, but it doesn’t feel worth it. Nothing feels worth sticking around. The pain has been never ending, constant, for months now. With the suicidal thoughts added in, I think I might actually do it. I don’t see anything or anyone that I value more than just ending the pain right now. 
I know its selfish, but I just want to feel peace for once in my life. I don’t think it will get better in my life. Depression and addiction are genetic in my family and multiple family members have passed from addiction or are severely dependent on medication and depressed now. I don’t really know what to do. I have multiple plans. Multiple scenarios. Multiple notes and instructions for post death. Just wanting to talk to people like me before I do it.",1

"I'm writing my note tonight.I will be apologizing to those I will hurt. Thanking those who have been a positive influence on my life.

I am bipolar that went undiagnosed most of my life which is a partial reason I am $40,000 in debt, all unsecured. I suffer from anxiety that nobody ever sees. I have told 3 people about these conditions and they were all supportive but in disbelief, all stating that they would have never suspected it. I guess after 31 years you get good at hiding it. I have tried a bunch of different medications that haven't helped. I have reached out and seen a therapist but nothing changes. I am an alcoholic (self medicating) that tried to stop but failed after 2 months.

I have been raped twice and never properly dealt with that. I have witnesses that saw me say I did not want to have sex with them. But yeah alcoholism I got black out drunk and woke up next to them. I am the only person that i associate with that isnt married. The last person that showed interest in me invited me back to her place, we went,  and then asked for money in exchange for sex. I had to walk the couple miles home. Before that its been over a year and that ended because of my alcholism, I don't blame her. I feel like a 31 year old manchild that never made it past the maturity level of an 18 year old.

I am looking into my two life insurance policies to see if it covers suicide. If it they dont I will find a way to make it look like an accident. I have $100,000 So it should cover my debt and and bury me. 

I have a means and method that would be clean and not subject a family or friend of finding me.

Edit: methods",1

I have BDD, ADHD, ASBERGERS and depression i can't live like this anymore, i was promised help by my doctor but been waiting over a year and still no letter about me getting help i feel hopeless.

"My heart is breaking over and over again.It's the symbolism, the meaning of the cutting. A physical manifestation of rejection. Action, a statement which nothing else can more profoundly state.

Even if it kills me, I want these fucking things gone so I can be closer to who I am in spirit. The blood is me making my devotion real.

I should have been different, very different. There is no cosmic justice. I'm desperate to. Cutting my genitals is the only expression of my non-maleness I have. I need to not be male. I'd do anything to not be AMAB. Gender validation would only carry me so far. There is only some healing, no complete recovery. Sell my soul to Satan? you got it. Convert to christainity or whatever religion? you got it. Participate in a genocide? you got it. Kill my parents?... maybe. 

I've got at most 20 months to live. The healthcare system doesn't give a fuck about human life. It's just yet another profit driven machine for its share holders. Just like the government its a business. They don't care how much pain they cause. They don't care if I or anyone else is dying. The only reason they act, is to further their business interests. It just happens to be the case that forever indebted little workers lives are occasionally worth saving. Humanity is just a ROI computation to them.",1

I figure that is probably not good so I'm thinking about going to a mental health facility and asking them to lock me up for a bit, if that's even how it works. Does anybody have any information on this they can share with me? Do I go to the nearest hospital ER and tell them I'm suicidal? Is there a specific thing to search for on the internet?

Let me add something else, it needs to be free. I think I literally have $130 in my bank account and that's all the money I have in the world. It can't be free now and they bill me later. I'm 31 years old and I live with my parents. Your typical basement dweller except without the basement. I also don't want my parents to have anything to do with it; I'd like to go to the hospital on my own. I'd like to tell my parents that I'm going to commit suicide and give them time to prepare but that is stupid. My plan has always been to wait until they die and then off myself so they won't have to go through that pain and I'd like to stick to that but I really think I'll go through with it if I don't get help soon.

Please help, I need all the info you can give. And also, please explain it to me like I'm five years old. I'm smart with some things but I'm a moron at actually accomplishing things in the real world. Thank you in advance.",1

"Stuck Abroad, Probably Now Is The TimeI'm thousands of miles away from my family, my gf is leaving me because I'm a cunt. I'm 23, no job. An alcoholic mother, a father who couldn't give a shit about me 95% of the time. I just think I'm at that point now. I will be stuck here thousands of miles away from family as I'm in rural Canada and I relied on my gf driving me to the airport when I had to leave. Now she wants me to sort an earlier flight and just find a way to leave. Well I can't. I'm probably autistic or some shit because I struggle to do what normal people could do. My life's a mess, and I ruined the one thing that kept me going and that was my relationship. If I knew some painless way to end it I would do it now, without hesitation. The only thing keeping me alive is being a pussy and too scared to do it. So I can't even kill myself properly. My fear makes me both want to kill myself and is also stopping me from doing it. Ironic, eh? Well I don't know what to do anymore, I can't be trapped here with no help. I honestly would call an ambulance but in Canada that means money that I don't have. So nahh, calling someone to save my life and then give me a $500 bill ain't worth it. All I can think of is that I managed to get to Canada and face one of my biggest fears (flying) so why can't I commit suicide? I'm excited by the thought! But too scared. I wish I had a dad that cared, one that had shown me how to be a good man. All he did was teach me to be an asshole then stopped caring when he perfected the art of making me a cunt. Well, if I do ever do anything then I just hope my mum knows how much I appreciated her. She's been there for me through everything, I just wish I could make her proud. But I'm a loser and I'm just done. The second I figure out a way to kill myself I will. Or if in the incredibly unlikely chance I can somehow get home in one piece then I at least can see my family one more time before deciding my fate.

Thank you if anyone bothered to listen, I don't want pity. If anything feel free to pm me insults, that's what I deserve",1
"A good plan to end it allI fell for a guy quite a while ago, he was French, I'm in a nearby European country.

I am 20, I don't study cause of depression, I got bullied for 6 years and my family is very insecure narcissistic people who told me to go ahead and do it. A person assaulted me when I was 13.

I'm been thinking about suicide or at least hurting myself for a while now. I'm taking medication and it helps, but the thoughts always find a way of creeping into my head usually during times of high stress. I'm a recent college graduate and I have been experiencing high stress at my new job. I cannot seem to perform at an acceptable level and I'm really starting to resent my job and my employer.  The thought of being fired at my first job post-college is enough to make me go over the edge. I cannot stand the possibility of being a failure. In addition I'm disillusioned with life in general and I don't feel I will ever make any kind of significant impact in any aspect of my life. I'm really overweight and I have tendency to overeat which is only making me bigger. I see all the people at work getting married and having kids, and all I can do is feel resentment and loneliness at not having someone of my own. It doesn't help that I'm gay in an extremely conservative state.  I would like nothing more than to leave this world right now.",1

After screaming to my face and stuff i didnt feel anything just my heart felt very heavy and with the amount of stress im having with college i just took my leather man and tried to slice my neck just out of curiosity if i could do it. Well turns out it was dull and now my neck is bleeding but not heavily and it stings. I stopped for 15 minutes to continue on my essay and thought i should give it another shot and tried to slice my other side of my neck. Nope its not sharp enough to cut through deep enough. Now i have several cuts on both my neck and they are bleeding and dont know what to do anymore. ,1

"because u/WilliamAfton131 did not update his profile to include how to hide a body, i will. the whole thing started when i saw this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursedcomments/comments/mj7f2v/cursed_purple/) on r/cursedcomments. in said post, it was revealed that u/WilliamAfton131 would update somewhere how to hide a body and since my 2-second search concluded that as false, i would enjoy doing this for him:

&amp;#x200B;

the first thing is to get a way to hide the body in plain sight. no open body in trunk thing. the suitcase can work for example. take the body fast before it gets to smell and suspicious. once you arrive at a very very secluded area, dig out a two-foot wide 10 ft or a bit less. don't dig a full wide body grave because choppers will look for 6 ft disturbed ground. also, take out teeth and hands so the body can is identified. next, cover the body in yogurt because bacteria can have their pick in dead bodies in your secluded area and will take longer to come around those lazy privileged assholes. anyway, after covering the body in yogurt (that bacteria love and will flock towards) lower it standing or head first into your small grave and cover it. depending on how far it is along put it in immediately or wait a bit. then cover in a layer of dirt (but thick enough so one shovel swoop won't reveal it) and then put a dead animal above. even better if you cover it in plants or foliage. the goal is to make sure the burial site isn't even discovered. if it is\*, hopefully, the animal will throw them off but even past that hopefully, the body is decomposed and unidentifiable so it cannot be traced back to you. 

\*but i doubt it because good luck finding a two-foot-wide disturbed ground under some plants. (also you are looking for 6 ft of disturbed ground if you are a police search team)

"Today I feel like dying

Dear Reddit, 

I am a fuck up.

I feel haunted.. 

Got in to three car accidents within a 2 month span. Totaled my car on Mischieve Night... Lost my job on the same night. Don't understand how or why I survived such a horrific accident. I don't understand why god wants me live and I'm pissed he didn't let me die.

My friends don't support me or understand how I feel. My family isn't there for me either nor do they care or understand what I am going through. I'm afraid to talk to the guy I'm dating about my issues because I don't want him to worry about me, but more accurately I'm afraid of him finding out how screwed up I actually am and then stop talking to me. 
I'm in such a financial hole I started to have sex with older men for money. I can't remember the last time I felt loved. I can't remember the last time I felt genuinely supported. I feel like I've never felt joy. I'm 22 and I can't remember what it was like to be a child. I can't feel joy. I think sex is the closest thing to happiness I'll ever achieve. I'm sure I'll end up addicted to hard drugs if I continue this lifestyle, but I don't know how to stop nor have a good reason to. I'm considering donating all my stuff to Goodwill and planning out my last days. I turn 23 next month, may commit suicide before then. ",1

"Waiting for the inevitableI don't really know how to explain the way I'm feeling, but I'll give it my best shot. It's been almost a year since I last attempted suicide (29th Jan). Since then, I just feel like it'll happen eventually. As in I will die by suicide at *some point*, whether that be now or in a few years. I've just lived day by day, feeling empty, and being shit scared of the fact I'm doing nothing. I'm 17 and not in college or school or work. I fucked up my test results at school, because of some weird thing inside me that seems to make me sabotage everything whenever it goes well. I'm just sitting here, thinking my future is most likely to live with my parents since I can't do anything for a couple years then kill myself, probably before I'm 20. I think COVID was actually a bonus to me, because it meant I had less pressure from family to get a job or go to college. If they kept up maybe I would've died this year. I can't stop thinking about how I felt when I attempted earlier this year and how happy I felt when I thought it was all going to be over.

To buy time to think what to do so I told her okay let’s go on a date and this is my first time going on a date so I asked my older friends they gave me tips and stuff and just told me to be me act as myself and not someone else so couple days later we go on a date it was weird walking around with a girl not the boys anyways we go and eat sushi I never had sushi before so we sit talk just like a normal date and then after that we start walking around   she was really brave doing all of that

I spoke to her best friend last night, said she was in favour of us getting back together, poured my heart out to her, she sees her, tells her I said she has no chance of getting with anyone again, spun my words, things spark into an argument, she super mad, I don't think i'm ever going to see her again, I explained what I said would is completely illogical since I want her back, this would never help me

I'm nineteen, failing out of college, my girlfriend of over a year is at a music festival, and I've found things on her Facebook of her planning to fuck an ex fling there. I confronted her about it and we had an actually very productive conversation about it.

While she has been there I've caught her in several lies, and just bullshit after bullshit. So there's that.

I'm also failing out of school, I'm not happy. I work as a waiter and get constantly berated by costumers all day. I hate my job. I hate school. 

I constantly fight with my parents now that I'm back home for the summer. We have always butted heads, and now they are planning on cutting me off because of it and because of grades. I was planning on moving in with the girlfriend eventually like we had talked about, but that doesn't seem to be happening.

I've attempted two times before, once when I was sixteen and another when I was seventeen. Hanging both times. I think I'll try something different now, probably OD. 

I'll probably end up waiting until she gets back and see how that goes. I'm trying my best to keep occupied and such. Oh did I mention that the money she used to go to the music festival mainly came from me before I found all of this out? So I paid for her to go fuck another dude. Good job me.

"A PropositionHi guys, first ever post on suicidewatch, and I am not even sure if this is allowed. If not, feel free to delete. Anyways, there always seems something so futile in trying to stop a suicide attempt over the internet. With this idea in mind, I thought that there has to be a solution, and I came up with an idea. What if someone developed an app that, when someone is feeling suicidal within a particular area, they simply request a person to be with. Said volunteer, or whoever was working that night would then venture to their location, and simply be there for them. Normally, from my experiences anyway, being physically present is absolutely key to helping people. It would almost be like a guardian angel type thing, completely free and available. Of course you would have to have volunteers for the program to assist in suicide prevention, and I can already think of many problems associated with the idea, but how feasible do you think the idea is generally?

"My end is near. I feel content and relievedLong story short, my life has been a long long time of suffering. Fucked up childhood that fucked me up (I possibly have BPD, or at least very drastic symptoms towards it), bullying and long time depression and suicidal thoughts for the last seven years if not longer. I'm writing this here because my friends and family are alarmed enough and well, I dont really want help. I just want to talk. To tell someone what I'm feeling.

I've tried to kill myself twice this year already, both time just being disappointed it didn't work. I dont see no way out, my moods wont stop and considering possible BPD and all the fucked up things that happen in my brain and the things I do I dont see it changing. I'm hurting the people around me and I can see it. Me dying won't be easy and I know it's a void that will never be filled in many hearts of that I know. But at this point, I find it hard to care. I'm at my happiest when I've thought that I'm finally dying. And with this, I won't be able to hurt those who I love anymore. Im terribly lucky to have them, to have such people love me, and they won't give up on me. I can't make them believe that I'm a lost cause or maybe them give up, I've realized. But I dont see myself backing out on this. I've lost the fear I used to have for death. I'm just very relieved it's all ending soon. I'm very happy.

Ever since she moved in with him a year ago she's been acting different. And he was so controlling. Whenever you were on the phone with her you could hear him in the background. Sometimes when I texted her he answered and that always seemed weird to me. She'd have random outbursts where she hated me then come back and cry and apologize until I forgave her. She was acting crazy and we were tryingso hard to get her help. 

He was generally an asshole. He harassed me several times simply for saying I didn't like him (he'd message me and call me a fat little bitch, tell me to kill myself, call me a dumb cunt and threaten to hurt me). He'd fill her head with lies and make her think we were abusing her and he was the only one telling the truth. He even enabled and encouraged her self harm/eating disorders cause he had a ""fetish"" for them. 

She finally moved in with us a week ago, because she finally managed to end it. He wasn't happy but she was and that's all that matters. But when we went back to her apartment to get her things... Oh my God. 

He left animals there. All alone without any food or water for a week. They were literally dying, the lizard couldn't even move at all. The place was a wreck .There was water everywhere and the furniture was flipped, glass smashed in the one room, food thrown across the floor and counters, carpet ripped up, piss all over the bathroom, literal shit in the corner.

"Struggling because I want to die but can’t bear to leave my childrenI’m 26. I’m married and have two kids. I have endometriosis and every day is excruciating pain. I can’t remember when I wasn’t in pain in 4 years. I can barely have sex. I miss sex so much. I can’t pick up my children. I rocked my son to sleep and threw up from the pain after. I had to leave my job. 

On top of that, I have severe PTSD. I have horrible memory, trust issues, anxiety, and I got frustrated very easily. I’ve been trying for years to get it under control. I thiught I was doing well but I guess not. My husband is very unhappy. He hates when I forget things, he thinks I just don’t try hard enough to remember. I’m very hard to deal with but I went to therapy every week for over a year. I’m out of my Zoloft right now and struggling. 

I have PTSD because my mother abused me my whole life. She also allowed her husband to molest me when I was a toddler and screamed at me when I told her I remembered. The argument culminated in her choking me until I passed out. When I didn’t come to school my teacher, who I shared with, called 911. She knew it was getting bad. My mom blames me and told the cops I had attacjed my little sister. Who was at school at the time. They still took me to a mental facility and treated me for homicidal tendencies for a week before a family member adopted me and took me out of state. My mother signed her rights away when I was 15. 

All of this to say, I want to die. My life is nothing but trying to deal with my pain and my broken mind. But I love my husband and I love my children so so so much. I don’t want to leave them. I feel like I’m being ripped in half and I don’t know what to do.  ",1

"From a ""not quite, but almost""A few weeks ago, I was planning to kill myself. The plan was very, very firmly implanted in my mind, and had been for the better part of a year. About a week ago, those thoughts began to subside for the first time I can remember. Today, I decided that I was mentally okay enough to get a little high and get in touch with myself. One of the biggest takeaways that I can share, from my own perspective (in the vein of, ""none of us matter and everything we know and everything we are is essentially going to be cosmic dust in the wind"") is if nothing matters, then we're only as meaningless as everything else is. Maybe it's amazing to be living in some fraction of a second in the lifespan of the universe, when we could just as well not be here. But for this infinitesimally small frame of space and time, our existence does matter. It does hold value. I hope that maybe the journey of discovering yourself is enough to keep you here for a little while.",1

"Selfish dickheads in team projects So I’ve been involved in a team project in school, and there’s this one guy who has done fuck all and admits he “couldn’t care less” because he didn’t like the task we were given. Bear in mind this was an optional project which everyone in the team applied for BY CHOICE and this guy sat there doing nothing for a whole year, knowing he didn’t like the project. Worse still, the supervisors did nothing even though they knew he was doing nothing and also MENTIONED AT THE START THAT THEY WOULD REPLACE ANYONE WHO DID NO WORK (as there were others who wanted to be on the team but there weren’t enough spots). I’m more pissed off at the fact that he’s been able to survive effectively just because he was friendly with the supervisors.

She loves it, but wanted to change some stuff on it.

"I need an idea for a monster. I'm writing a short story about three teenagers spending a night in a spooky forest on a dare. They're going to encounter something supernatural and I want it to fit who they are and reflect their fears.

First character is a girl named Catherine that is scared of almost everything. Her family is extremely Christian and conservative and she is trying very hard to reject the fact that she likes girls because she's been taught that homosexuality is a sin.

Second character is named Nack, she trys her best to support her friends no matter what. She doesn't care what happens to her or other people as long as her friends and family are happy and safe. Her worst fear is failing those she cares about and she will do anything to make sure that fear isn't realized.

Third character is named Sheena, she's a trans girl but this story takes place before she fully realizes that so it's not going to be mentioned outright, only hinted at. She's paranoid and doesn't trust easily at all. She doesn't confine in people often because of that. She gets angry easily and is kinda the leader of the group.",0
"My brother killed himself last year and I want to do the same thing nowHe had lifelong depression and so I. I'm in my early 40s, female, and have been through an insane amount of loss and pain, particularly in the last few years. 

The most recent loss was a ""friend"" who I thought would be the one person who would always be there for me. He wasn't. He has gone, without even a goodbye; I've tried a couple of times to reach out, to apologise, but I have been utterly cut off. He knew everything about me. I can't see meeting anyone else. I am too depressed, too withdrawn. And how would I be able to trust anyone else after him anyway? 

I have a debilitating chronic disease which is incurable and which isn't going to get any better. I've already had enough of hopsital appointments, tests, pain, etc. to last five lifetimes. I don't want it any more. 

I am also desperately, desperately, desperately lonely, despite having an absolutely lovely female friend. But I am scared of ultimately driving her away one day too: I have everyone else. 

Put simply, I have nothing left to live for. I'm in 10/10 mental pain nearly all the time. I've tried about 8 or 9 different antidepressants over the years; none of them have worked for longer than a few weeks - or a few months at absolute most. Some left me in a worse state than before I began them. I have no interest in trying any more antidepressants. 

Therapy is unaffordable.  

My dilemma is this: I desperately want to end the pain, as I cannot go on like this for much longer - I just can't. But I don't want to put my parents through a second suicide; I would swap places with my dead brother in nanoseconds. (He may not thank me for that, but I don't give a shit.) 

I am stuck in a special kind of hell. I want to wait until my parents pass. They are elderly but it could still be another 10-20 years. No way I can hold out that long. ",1
"Completely lost my self.A week or two ago I wrote my suicide letter, I emailed it to an account to give to my ex if she would even bother to log in to it in the first place, so she could ""handle"" my goodbye's considering I can't speak to anyone anymore, even my own mum.

I'm completely socially wrecked - staying in and just trying to sleep all day to keep my self from the ""boredom"" that drags me deeper into the depression and loneliness probably doesn't help the situation, but it's just feels like a black hole that sucks me in no matter what I try and do.

Every friend that I had left me, which was foreseen by my ex before we broke up over a year and a bit ago now, which leads me to think it is just my personality and I'm not wired to be in this world, and it's my fault.

The day I wrote that suicide letter was gonna be the night I did it and I flaked on it, I don't know why because I know there isn't going to be anything for me in the future, I don't have any life skills or something that makes me feel connected to the world, I'm 19 and have now been unemployed for over 9 months still living under my mums roof with a horrible atmosphere that doesn't help.

I know in the future I won't be able to look after my self and I'll just end up homeless and kill my self on the streets, I figure I should just cut out even more pain before it happens. I'm satisfied with 17 shitty years and and a few good years, why make the former number bigger and leave the latter the same.

I'm hoping soon one night I'll give the account to her and I'll just go ahead and finally end it, because it's felt overdue for a while.",1

"""My biggest regret in life is you."" help.I was raised by my controlling narcissistic mother. I'm not going to get into the f**ked up stuff because I'm honestly feeling the absolute worst I've felt in a very long time. Worthless. Unwanted. Unloved. A waste of time. An accident.

This is what happened today; late last night my brother (15) accidentally dropped the ""f"" bomb while playing a video game, in his room, with the door shut, around 1 am. My mom has been known to lurk around the house to try to catch either my brother or I doing something, so she can do a full search of your phone, your room, literally everything you own will be searched through. This is why she was able to take his phone and proceed to look through it at 1 am.

My twitter is private. I rarely use it, but I follow my brother and he follows me. Since my mom has his phone, she can now see my tweets. Now, several months ago I had tweeted ""I think it's funny that my mom hates me"" because she was acting very hateful, and actually hit me and told me she hated me. She sends me a screenshot of the tweet and I confront her via text about it later.


This is what happened.

"Please help me. Please give me advice.I don't think I want to kill myself. I like living. But I don't have any real hope for my life. Suicide is the best, most rational option.

I'm in my 20s and I'm still living with my parents. I went to college and got a worthless degree and worked a terrible job for years and had to quit because my boss was physically harassing and threatening me and the company wouldn't do anything about it. Of course I had no back-up plan. I was unemployed for a year and did nothing. My parents threatened to kick me out of the house unless I got a job or got into a program at a school. I ended up getting into a post-bacc program for medicine. My parents were so proud of me because they thought it was my first step to becoming a doctor. But that's never going to happen. First and foremost I'm too fucking stupid. And second, *I don't want to do that shit.*

I have suffered from mental illness all my life. I've tried to kill myself three times before, been institutionalized, all that happy horseshit. I was an alcoholic throughout my early twenties. I have no friends. I have no skills. My parents are fucking nuts. I *love* them, but they're fucking nuts. My mum lives in a bubble world. She hasn't worked since she was in college and spent all her time raising me and now that I'm older she has no hobbies or friends. My dad is a Trump-supporting fanatic who still thinks it's the 1980s. They don't understand the world. They don't want to. They're real boomers. 

I have no plans, no money, no credit, no ambitions, no desires. I don't want to have children. I don't want to get married or have a house. I don't want to work. I'm pathetic. I don't function correctly. So why the fuck prolong it?",1

My dad takes his meds and my mom is going for a check up soon. But my anxiety about their future death is unberably strong. I know I wont be able to cope. I dont have many friends. 

I will end up lonely and crying every day. I feel absolute zero control over their destinies but the only destiny I have control over is mine.

"Hey there! Thinking about killing myself.So I've been depressed for a long time, first time I felt like this I was 14 years old, I'm 21 now. It kinda' comes and goes.

I'm on my final year of university and although I got good grades I don't think I can finish this year, which I would be terribly sad if I didn't, and it's what's likely to happen. Studying is one of the few things I enjoy doing, but when I'm depressed I can't even read a paragraph before thinking about killing myself.

I've been trying to fake it till' you make it approach since my first year. I'm popular around campus, throw a lot of parties, I'm not bad looking and I pretend not to be shy so socially I'm really good at pretending to be a extovert, outgoing guy. Though my friends have been suspecting that my heavy drinking and drug use is a excuse to hide something else, an assumption which they are more likely correct.

I like people, I feel an empathy that is abnormal, which is a recurring issue in making me depressed. If I see someone sad or miserable looking I instantly feel how I think that person is feeling, hollow. I could be the richest, most sucessful, best looking person in the world, I would still be depressed, there's nothing that can change this.

I just don't like life, and I fail to see any way that it would be better.

Although I might feel empathy I can't actually like anyone, I can't love anyone that I've found in my live. I hate being around my friends and family and I hate to pretend I enjoy it. They are good people, but it's annoying to be around people that don't understand, not depression, but how meaningless is anything they say or do. Nothing makes any sense.

The only thing that keeps me going is that I only get one living, it's obvious I will have a happy day in my life, actually I bet I still haven't lived my happiest day. But is it worth it? Would you live your life as a begger, just because you know that in your last day you would be a billionaire?

All I do all day now is sit on my computer ranting online about how disgusting looking I am. People try and console me, but it doesn't make me feel any better. The fact is I am arguably the least attractive guy on the planet.

"Alright people. Listen up. I've never been one to be political, but I feel like I just have to get this off of my chest.

BLM stands for Black Lives Matter, but really advocates that *all* lives matter. This a legitimate organization that enjoys protesting peacefully to get their point across. However, some of their protests turn into riots. It's not their fault though.

ANTIFA stands for Anti-Fascist. However their actions really prove that *they* are fascists. They are the ones who turn protests into riots. They steal, they hurt, and their ideals aren't good ones either.

They say they want socialism, which means that everyone benefits, but like all others who have attempted socialism in the past, the real agenda is Communism, in which everyone is equally poor. 

They also want to get rid of religion entirely. They've been tearing down statues of Jesus and Mary, and it won't stop there. Soon enough, if they haven't already, they'll start to tear down statues of Buddah, Gahndi, etc. As a Christian, I don't agree with any of this. The freedom of religion is what founded this country, and now ANTIFA is trying to take away this and other freedoms. 

I know we aren't old enough to vote yet, but we are the future of America. When we turn 18, it'll be our responsibility to make sure whoever is in a seat of political power has Amerca's best interests at heart.

I'm a Republican, but not a Trump supporter. The only good thing he's done throughout all of the Covid-19 pandemic is that special ops team to combat Epstein's child pornography ring.

I end with this: I can't tell you what's right and what's wrong, but I can give you facts. These are the facts that I know of, so I'm just gonna give them to you like they are.

Please if you have someone who’s not too far gone like I am, talk to them. Be there for them. Support them. They need you more than ever. Don’t let them slip. You will regret it when they’re gone. 

The world would be a better place if there was more love. ",1

"How do I break the cycleHi my names well say Poncho. I'm 22 years young and I have a really good life. Im successful and everything is good...Or so it seems.. I have had loads of problems when it comes to dealing with my emotions. I cannot for the life of me figure out how to express them in the right way. Rather it me blowing up on somebody, breaking things, or threatening suicide. I've ""attempted"" 2 times because I think so low of myself and whenever I try to change I make the same mistakes over and over. Hung myself in high school the rope wasnt sturdy enough and broke. Took that as a ""sign"" fast forward years still am ""good"" but dont know how to properly handle my emotions still out of high school now. Find a girl whom gets pregnant immediately and we try making it work. Babys born I loved him for nearly a year and then it comes out he is not mine. [Its a loooooong stary] Obviously hurt I slit my wrist, the blade went at an angle now I'm left with this big ass scar down my left arm. I forgive her we get back together to have a family and 5 years later with my emotional and physical toxicity she leaves. I know what I do, understand why I do it. But no matter how hard I try I cannot control my emotions. Currently feeling like it would be easy to give up, more now than ever that I don't have my family. How do I change or how can I let her go I know she doesn't want me anymore and she actually made alot of progress in me. Sorry if it dont make sense I've been depressed not eating right and it's all just taking a toll. I'm ready. Been ready so why am I still here",1
"Need some help, been in a really dark place lately.So about a month ago at this point, my parents discovered the text messages between me and my boyfriend, the issue with this is that they didn't know I had a boyfriend... To say they were upset would be a massive understatement. 

They are very strong Christians and me being gay goes against what they believe. Now don't get me wrong I am a strong believer myself, however the details of what I believe to be true about the Lord and such differs slightly from what they believe. 

As a reaction to the situation they took away my phone, car keys, any and all video games that I had, and all WiFi access. They even completely blocked communication between him and I. I understand that they paid for roughly 80% of everything they took, but it still seems like a huge overreaction. Since then I've only gotten back the ability to simply listen to music, and it doesn't seem like I'll be getting anything else back anytime soon. I have no communication with any of my friends and I feel like I'm being held hostage. I have nowhere to look and nobody that I trust to turn too.

I've just been really depressed and so bored that I've literally spent hours staring at my wall from time to time. I feel like I have no escape, I know that suicide is an awful thing, and I don't want to go down the same path I went through about 4 months ago. All I'm looking for is some advice and some encouraging words or something. I just feel like I've deeply embarrassed and disappointed my parents. They've told me multiple times already that they aren't disappointed, but it seems hard to believe considering what they're putting me through. I'm honestly just lost and confused because of all of this, and I'm really scared..

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated, I just need someone to help me out. Thank you.",1
"I've been toxic for too long...I used to think that people distanced from me... But instead, I was the one who distanced from them...

When I think about my past... I was so childish, so inmature, so clingy, so negative and so annoying that I understand why people didn't want to get close to me...

Being honest... When I think about my future, I'm afraid that I'll end up dying alone, old and broken in my home, maybe 60-70 years in the future, and no one will find me for a long while...

I don't know how to face some people, I don't know how to apologize, or if I should do so, I don't know how to start being another person...

I don't even know how to deal with a misdiagnosis, I don't know how to tell people that I don't have Asperger's when they think I have, and I'm not sure how to keep dealing with being treated like a child...

God, I lost a lot of things when I was depressed... And I don't know how to get them back or how to start moving on...

Without internet at home, it's really difficult to think about other stuff...

I wish I could be born again so I could fix all of those mistakes...",1

I remember when I was still hopeful. Thought there was a way out, that I could recover somehow. Everytime I go to subs about mental illness and I see people talking about how they got triggered by their SO or work or at the bar or whatever. And I just can't stop thinking ""dude I *wish* I had your problems. You have got your life together, you're upset over things that are so minor to me, fucking hell. 

I have a concrete plan now. It's the first time I have one. Before it was just the wish to kill myself. Now I am going to do it, when I feel ready. There is no way out. Fuck everyone who says recovery is bumpy and hard. Fuck off. You have **no** idea.",1

Alright so I was going through YouTube you know as you do, and I saw this video named [the family friendly noose song](https://youtu.be/VJe6LLoGgR8) so it's a song about how to tie a noose pretty self explanatory anyway I thought it was funny as the world is just going to shit so I watched and sent it to a friend with this exact words "" bro does yt want me to commit suicide this showed up in my recommended"" and apparently he still has his phone monitored so his mommy called my mother saying that I was thinking of  hanging myself and that I was desperate. A day before I was asking for username ideas for another app and he suggested hoeza134 and I said "" honestly I'ma try if I get too desperate"" do I guess they got it from that but they twisted it into me being highly suicidal and desperate to *end it* so they broke into my room FBI style took away my phone my tablet to monitor all my text and search history I had to argue for 30 minutes to get it back. After she called my siblings telling them I was suicidal and to talk to me. Now their thinking of monitoring my phone and blocking everything that can be seen offensive. I won the argument after two hours and showing them my texts multiple times. She did not inform my siblings however so I had to explain it to them.

My life at school is fucking anarchy. I'm only good at one subject. I'm already a year behind and time is running on me. I'm supposed to be going to uni next year but because I failed I have to do an extra year (I'm 18 for context; in the UK we go to college at 16 for 2 years, then uni. I failed the first year), all because of my mental health. I have depression which I only recently got diagnosed with as well as Body Dysmorphic Disorder, and you know what Reddit, I am *fucking tired of it*.

Tired of taking medication, tired of fucking up at school, tired of spending majority of my time alone because I only have 5 friends. I always feel isolated and excluded. I've never been to a party, I don't even fucking go out regularly, partly because of the BDD and not wanting to leave the house without makeup. All I ever seems to do is piss people off and disappoint them. 

Most of all I'm tired of myself. I don't even fucking do anything, I just sit down and think and think and think until I either cry or vomit. I don't learn, or have hobbies. I don't *live*. I'm just there.

Go to school, feel depressed, go home, feel depressed. Rinse and repeat until I wanna blow my head

 I feel like a massive burden.

I don't know what the future holds for me.

I can't even get a job because my BDD likes to fuck me over.

I lost my job and the wealth I built up, I was successful and was earning a lot of money, had fancy cars, clothes, ect. Now I struggle to figure out where my next meal will come. I realize it is possible to recover from this illness but I think I am in too deep. I just wish there could be more awareness to the survivors that this is the best thing for us, that our suffering is over and we can finally find solace.

I've been basically okay recently but just about three years ago I moved from where I grew up in a small town in Indiana and have really missed it ever since. Within those past years I have been on-and-off fighting (nothing abusive/physical) with my mother whom I love very much about stupid, little things. However, me being emotional, everything gets to me and drags me down a little more. I can happily say that I have never cut myself or actually attempted suicide, but I have hit/punched myself many times. I don't really know where to turn to. I have a lot of friends but my closest wouldn't take it seriously or I'm the one staying strong for them because they have gone through serious depression.

"I'm really not emotionally capable of having friends.Seriously. I'm too sensitive for my own good. If a friend of mine messages me something to let me know about something I'm doing wrong I literally just go into breakdown mode. 

I can't stop thinking of that time two years ago, when someone I thought was my best friend told me they had lied all that time I knew them and they never cared about me or the things I made. I can't take any chances. If a friend and I have a disagreement I immediately assume that they never cared about me or anything I said to them in the first place and that I'm a dumbass for even trying to trust again. But yet I don't blame them. I do impulsive things when I'm in a depressive and panicked state; not self harm but more like I just burn the bridges even harder than I should. I leave group chats and say shit I don't mean. 

I've had this my entire life. I've waited for so long to see when it ""gets better"" and I have lived through depression in childhood all the way through to adulthood and it never did get better. It's getting worse, even, with work and college draining my very being. 

I pray to whatever's out there every single day that I die in my sleep or from sickness or something that would be deemed not my own doing. I can't do that to my family; I can't have them living with the guilt if I killed myself. But I am close to doing it, and I will make it look like an accident.",1

I saw this coming - we became friends through our suicide pact, after all.  I knew that she would go someday but I had hoped that we would go together.  My heart aches and all I want to do is kill myself.  It feels like the right thing to do.


I'm going to miss our midnight talks of plans that we knew we would never carry out - long roadtrips, star gazing on the countryside, visiting all those Californian landmarks.  If the universe would give me another chance, if she somehow lived, I would find a way.  I would find the money and we would do everything we ever talked about.  God I wish she hadn't had done that.",1

"Life is hardI'm not contemplating suicide, my infant needs me and she has an allergy to both soy and dairy products (ergo no formula). It's just hard. It's hard being so happy in the moment and it all gets torn down by my innermost thoughts. I don't deserve this happiness, I don't deserve the joy of watching this innocent little human learn and grow. But she needs me. And she loves me. I mean, she genuinely loves me and looks at me as her mommy and not for my flaws. My husband can't even do that. I honestly can't recall whether or not he ever did.

My heart hurts. My soul hearts. Everything aches from the pain of my regrets. Regrets for who I am, who I'm not, where I am in life, my failures, my overwhelming and consuming insecurities and the inability to be an adequate provider for my family.

I'm a piece of shit. I hate myself and everything I am.

Fuck mental health, fuck the mental health care system, fuck my shitty family that isn't there for me when they should be, fuck the people who bullied me and abused me, fuck the world.

I've always hated my life, I don't have any close friends, I mean I know a lot of people but I'm not in contact with any them, I've had suicidal thoughts for quite some time now but I didn't believe I would actually go throught with it.

But lately my life has gone downhill to a point where I don't think I can handle it anymore. It seems impossible to find a job, got scammed out of the only opportunity I had to earn some money and was left with nothing, my country's going through an economical crisis and I see no other way out of this.

"R/suicidology banned!Suicidal ideations can often be coping mechanisms, one might not be intent to committing suicide but just the thought of knowing that the option is there mitigates the suffering of life.

"Fed up of trying to be happy.A few weeks ago I was feeling really depressed and suicidal, I’m in the UK so what I’m saying will probably resonate more with people from here. I’ve been under NHS mental health services now for a couple of year, suffered with I’d say clinical depression now since I was 13 I’m now 25. And I can’t remember last time I had a happy spell in my life. The other week things got really bad was contemplating taking my own life, I didn’t the crisis team got involved and saw them everyday for a week until was passed back over to my mental health worker. But have been told I don’t have a medication review until early June so I don’t have any medication for nearly a month I can definitely see myself deteriorating in that time. I’m just fed up with the pain and wondering if I should just end it as this government don’t care or the’d not of slashed funding over the year for mental health services, I’ve got a lot going on and scared about my future but the support services out there seem very few and far between.

"Ending it | A storyWell as the title said, ""a story"" I will be telling you about my story. My suicidal life.

So, I have attempted to kill myself 23 times. All of which I am trying to hang myself. I have cut myself so many times, of all the bullies that taunt me. I have nothing to live for and I want to end it. I have no friends, I have no relationships, I have no family (Mom and Dad, and brother are always working) So I have to time to spend with my family, I am a social outcast, all my friends left me, I was in possession of a knife in my 7th grade year, I have no connections of the outside world. My parents are divorced by my dad pays child support and I usually seem him every 3 times a week. My dog died recently, so that makes me even more depressed. All this because my friend Chris, told me I was worthless and bullies me everyday at school.

I wrote a diary about it... How my life is now and then and that seemed to help sort of... I cut myself and drew blood and wiped it all over my diary where I wrote words. And at the bottom of the page that ""I had a horrible day at school"" there was half a page left  and I just said all over the place scatted on my paper: ""Here's not here"" ""Cruel World to live in"" ""Dead over god"" ""Life is PATHETIC"" ""Don't stay"" ""Leave this world"".

I cried today and even attempted to hang myself once again. I can not live anymore. Every single day, I think about suicide. How the awful ways, on how the days go by... And I just do nothing. Someday all those people who die by suicide, will look down at me, and tell me to end it of what I am going through. I just might do it after all. ",1

"I need immediate help.I'm a 19 year old boy, and have been heavily depressed and suicidal since I was 12, when I for the first time, tried hanging myself. 

I've been seeking help since age 14, but with no great succes.
For the last years I've failed different educations, because of my mental condition which is slowly tearing me apart. 

I am constantly imagining guns to my head, ropes around my neck, the ground smashing my body, etc. and it haunts me, even when I'm in a somewhat good mood. 

About a year ago when I help finally came, I was by mistake diagnosed as a schizophrenic. I had to walk around with this dagnosis hanging over my head, and swallow anti-psychotics that would eventually make me fall asleep in the middle of every morning classes. After a half year, I demanded a new diagnosis because I've NEVER been psychotic.
After a single conversation with a leading doctor, I was diagnosed with dystymia and heavy depressions.

I was prescribed prozac, and when I started on 30mg things suddenly became joyful. I was open-hearted, I was happy and I had confidence. While everything suddenly was going well, I decided to drop acid with some friends (all of us with an already daily usage of cannabis) It was wonderful and for the next 2 weeks I was happy. I dumped by girlfriend through 2 years at the time. I was certain that I would start from scratch. All of a sudden girls were attracted to me. I had no problems getting laid, and my friends' jealousy, was a sign to me that I was on the right track. I was sure that the days of my suffering had end, and I could finally be happy.
For some reason ONE weekend could destroy all those thoughts. I've had the best days of school ever. As another weekend approached everything went great. But after the weekend, I was back in school and NO ONE seemed as happy as me. Suddenly depression hit me. I was lonely again. Yeah I was happy, but no one around me were. Ever since then I've been extremely depressed. I'm losing friends and I'm losing my grip. It seems to all start over again. For the last month I've tried suicide 5 times. Last time yesterday. My only will is to die in peace. I am a lonely soul.",1

"How do things get betterFor those who have had these feeling and now feel better, what changed?

Did the reasons that you want to kill yourself become resolved, (by your own doing, or they resolved themselves) , 
 
or does how you feel about said problems eventually change and you just cope better about them. 

I want to kill myself for a number of reasons.  I've worked to better myself and try and solve some problems over the past year and I've failed at it all. I really just hate myself and there's no hope for me to try anything else. Im only here still because of how it would affect family and friends. Overtime though you tend to care less about that. I have 11 letters written to friends and family, and I'm ready to go. As more time goes by, I keep looking back and thinking how long I've felt like this. And that next month might be better but it never is. I don't know what to do anymore, I honestly feel that I have these thoughts for a reason and that I need to die or something",1

"Losing hope and reaching my breaking pointI really feel like a person can only take so much stress before they reach their breaking point. And I feel like I’ve been trying to go through life and pretend everything is fine but I feel like I’ve finally reached my breaking point. 

I do have a mood disorder as well as severe anxiety. I have actually had a mental healthcare provider tell me, after seeing me for awhile, that she doesn’t understand how I function with the level of anxiety that I have. I don’t either. 

I also have physical health issues now. I’m sick almost all the time and sometimes will be up until 1 or 2am just waiting for the pain to subside so I can sleep. 

I started dating someone who makes me so happy about six months ago and our relationship has been amazing but now all of a sudden it feels like these hard issues are arising. We’re both overwhelmed and struggling so I feel like I can’t lean on him for support anymore. 

And the icing on the cake was starting family therapy with my family. Which felt like being gaslighted for 45 minutes. But now I’m sitting here questioning everything and wondering if they’re right and I’m just too dramatic and I’m just ruining everything around me for no reason.

"Academic suicide...I have bipolar II and it tends to flare up in the spring and I get into a funk that's really hard for me to deal with. I've had to withdraw more than once during spring because of this. It typically starts when I fall behind for some reason and it's so hard for me to catch up again or when I think I won't do well on an assignment so I beat myself up mentally about it. 

Normally I cope with it by talking to my family but they're busy today. I just missed the deadline for a take home test which I haven't even started. I know what I want to write but I can't bring myself to start typing. This is killing me because I have some teachers who know about this and have worked with me in the past to help me out, this is a new teacher for me and I really wanted to make a good impression. For once I didn't want to be that student who can do good work, but can't do assignments on time due to depression in a teacher's eyes. I regularly earn A and B's on my assignments when I turn them in. I just want to break this cycle for once but I'm just having a really hard time doing so.

I've been meaning to talk to my school's disability office about this but I've inquired in the past and they've always told me that I need an official diagnosis which I can't afford right now. I can't use my current one because they say it has to be within a year but stuff like this doesn't just go away... Ok.

This is so frustrating since I know it'll happen again during midterms (depending on the courseload) and ALWAYS during finals. I think I'm in real trouble this semester because I'm taking mostly challenging classes and don't have a blow off one to help restore my confidence.

I'm not suicidal per se but this feels like committing academic suicide. I've been doing everything else except writing my test because I'm just so freaked out and worrying about not doing well.

Not sure if I want to talk to a hotline... Just need someone to talk with me.",1

I made a choice to understand the world and appreciate every form of life, including myself, for what it does, for how millions and millions of years of evolution assembled together this hands that write here, these eyes that read here, this body, of which Nature made it special. Now, should I just throw all of that away, just because I am stuck in my head, in my misconceptions, in my past or in my future, in my current ""me""? 

*""Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"".* You know, the more you think about those words, the more you realise you are your greatest project. Think about a future you, where that future you will tank the present you for taking that extra step, that extra tiny bit of force, to carry on the next day. 

If you believe in uncertainty, your whole life will be uncertain. The strenght to carry on it is always within you and nobody can take that from you. Nobody except yourself!

Cheers. Stay strong.  ",1
"I think I'm losing my only hopeIt's not like it's especially a good one, wanting a friend that doesn't want you is probably more unhealthy than anything.
But it's the only thought I had when I took pills and before I could take more I thought that if I could have another chance with him I'd be making a grave mistake.

I'm starting to think my mistake was to choose to stay alive. My mom is being a bit more supportive but only because she saw what happened but I still have no reasons to live in this life that I hate so much. If it's not now it'll just be later anyway.

I want to get help but I also want my friend back, my last friend. I can't imagine just ""moving on"" even if he's the worst I believe in him and I know he can change like he said he wanted to back then.
But I guess it's the rule of my life being abandoned even by relatives, I'll probably make some people sad if I died but there definitely won't be that many people at my funerals anyway and yes it makes me feel better to be able to keep the damage at a minimum and it's why I didn't feel bad attempting.

"My friend tried to kill himself. Details below.Alright I'm in alternative school for marijuana and I'm 15, my friend got caught with synthetic K2 and was supposed to be sent to alternative with me. Now he was molested at the age of about 6 and has been the main cause for most of his depression, which I think initially led him to smoking (we all have our reasons) but instead of coming to alternative school his parents sent him to a local drug rehab and mental health facility. A few days ago he tried to kill himself by hanging himself with his bedsheets. Luckily he was stopped but now he is going to stay there for the rest of school most likely. He has no contact with anyone outside. I was just wondering if there is anything I can do while he is in or after he gets out to help? Thanks.

"Attempted last night (and failed)For what it's worth, this is not my first attempt in the last half a year and I've always woken up drowsy for a day or too but fine. 

I was on Lexapro on and off for almost a decade for depression until I developed a debilitating anxiety disorder and had to switch. I have currently been on Paxil for almost three months, titration up and now I have been on 50mg CR daily. 

While the anxiety has receded I am still managing it with Xanax XR. The new dose of Paxil makes me sedated in the morning (I take it at night) but then when it wears off I am struck with anxiety and very strong suicidal thoughts. 

I feel like I have exhausted all options, when I emailed my pdoc he asked me to stay on the Paxil as it could just be ""side effects"". I can't even make see him until the end of June as he will be on holiday. 

Previously my husband and I considered hospitalisation but the state mental health care in my country sucks, private hospitals are way too expensive, and I don't know if they can help me at all, considering I am not ""unstable"".

"Pushing people away;People spend their whole lives looking for someone to love them, but when it happens to me, I have the overwhelming urge to run away. As soon as I feel myself slipping into that sweet intoxicating feeling of reciprocal love, I immediately shut down. It’s not rose-colored bliss for me. It’s a tangled knot of anxiety, an endless battle between my head and my heart.Logically, I know I’m being crazy. I realize that when you find someone who cares about you, you’re never supposed to let him or her go. But then my heart always seems to loudly protest, declaring that it doesn’t want to be anyone else’s. That it’s safer if it were only my own.
The undeniable truth about getting close to someone is that you give them part of your heart. It doesn’t matter if it’s big or small, you give part of it away. And once you do that, the person who holds your heart controls some part of your happiness. All of a sudden, you can’t help but feel butterflies when they look at you or quiet the pounding in your chest when they say your name. You wish you could make it stop, to gain back some of the control of your emotions, thoughts, sanity, but you can’t. You hate that they can make you more joyful that you could even imagine or the fact that in a second, they could break you. And that’s the beautiful, messy and truly terrifying part of it.He asked me not to run away, but would understand if I did.

"I hate being hereSince the age of 6 I've been suicidal.

The fact that I've tried several times in the past to kill myself and I'm here hurts even more. I can't kill myself. I'm scared of the pain or messing it up.

"I’m actually so sick of being aliveI don’t want to physically kill myself but I wish someone or something else would do it for me just so there could be a different stigma while I still reach the same end goal. I’ve been so stressed so much in the last year in particular and it’s gotten to a point where I don’t think I even understand myself at all anymore. I reach literal points where just thinking about having to be alive for the next couple of hours and days and weeks stresses me out even more and I feel trapped in this inescapable time of having to be alive and go through the pain of life. I’ve never talked to anyone in my life about the feelings of depression and suicide I’ve been feeling to different extents for over five years now and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to talk to someone in person about it which makes me feel like it’s just a matter of time until I purposefully get myself into a situation that gets me killed. I almost want that to happen. 

I know I can’t actually kill myself by my own hand because I promised I wouldn’t do that for the sake of my mom, dad, and sister. And while that’s probably the actual ONLY reason I’m still alive it’s almost painful how it locks me into this life when sometimes I just hate being in it. I feel so stuck.

I am a wreck due to depression and anxiety that stem from childhood abuse from my family.

I no longer speak to my family, and haven't done so in over a decade.

I am homeless.

I am tens of thousands of dollars in debt.

I am alone.

It's cold. 

I am hungry.

I have an ingrained sense of worthlessness due to my childhood abuse.

I'm a failure. And not in the ""woe is me"" way. I know I can't actually do the things I need to do to make my wife better, my sons happy, my daughter a whole and complete person when it's time for them to be ""adults"". I'm marginally ""there"" when I'm not at work and when I'm at work I barely know what I'm doing. Pretty much decided tonight that I would end the years of depression and let my wife (who is becoming very successful) raise these kids without all of the hangups I've developed over the years. I know it will be hard for her, but she is a resilient woman and made it to where she is by sheer hard work. I can barely stand to wake up and function. I dont get it. I had dreams. I had aspirations. I had ideas. But I'm fucked up in the head. I only hope I havent damaged my kids in the process. Dont really know what else to say, this might be the most expressive I've been in years.",1

My brothers are dumb Si my to younger brothers played Among us. And was having a great time.

I think about jumping off the bridge or into traffic almost every day but then I’ll feel fine the next (bipolar 2) no one checks in on me. my family never asks how I am and friends don’t either, most of my friends from my hometown haven’t bothered even texting me since I moved. My brothers have both struggled with depression in the past, my little brother is having a lot of trouble right now many states away from me. I check in on him and call. I can’t do anything while he’s having so much trouble it would be a bad example to set.  But it hurts that no one checks in on me or takes me being suicidal seriously. Even therapists. I don’t know what to do. I never pictured being this old. I was abused as a kid and feel like I just wasn’t mentally snapped in and present until college and sometimes I snap out again",1

"My friend wants to kill herself. And I don't know how to helpFirst of all my english is not that good so i'll be using google translater. I can't speak about this in russian websites because they're all stupid.  
We became internet friends maybe 5 years ago, since then we are really close. She can tell me whatever she wants and if she will feel better after, i'll be all ears.   
She's 7 years older than me (i'm 23).  she has a difficult life. after the divorce of her parents, the mother began to hate her daughter since childhood. Until now, her mom is very toxic. ""Others may have a good life, but you don't, because it's you. You ruin everything as always"" her mom says that.    
of course my friend thinks so because her closest relative is telling that.   
She doesn't have close friends in real life so it's really hard to feel that you're not alone.   
Many bad things happens in everyone's life. She already have few suicide attempts but at that time she was afraid to make it to the end. Right now she's feeling so bad. She's not afraid anymore. She wants to stop feeling that pain. She has  hallucinations about her ex and bad things that he has done to her. When she thinks about suicide she feels good and free. She thinks that it's an escape for her. And everything will be good without her.  


It will happen in 2 week. And i don't know what to do, what to say to her. What can i say? ""Don't worry. Everything will be okay"". Well it's stupid to say that. In her place i'd gave up a long time ago. I can't come to her and help her (10000 km apart). The waiting kills me. I don't know how to help her.",1

"Am I Weak?Do you know the phrase: ""Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem""? When you can't get a job in a dead-end town, that's a temporary problem, right? What about when you cut ties with your father because he'll never be satisfied with who you are? Maybe.

Maybe I need to vent. Maybe I need a way out. When I look at the pros and cons all I really have is a supportive grandmother and my girlfriend. They're probably the only reason I haven't committed suicide yet. I guess I am weak. All the other people with problems on this SR, what makes me so special, right? 

I hate it when I don't want any of these people to give up - random strangers or those close to me - but here I am wanting to give up. I know what its like to feel worthless, broke, alone, so why does life like throwing more shit at us? No one will care. No, that's just what I think. It's how I feel. I'm so tired of struggling.

"I’m ready to end my life right now.I just turned 20 and as of the last few weeks I’ve had serious thoughts of suicide. I’ve had thoughts of suicide before and going as far as leaving a suicide note, but had never acted on it. This is the first time I’ve felt compelled to post about this or tell anyone for that matter because the thoughts are getting worse by the day. My life isn’t horrible and I’ve been doing very well for myself since becoming an electrician and have had a solid group of friends for years. For some reason I feel an emptiness and my depression is getting worse. I’ve been having recurring nightmares of me dying in very traumatic ways and have been crying a lot. I don’t know what to do and I guess this is a last ditch effort of turning for help. The one thing that’s stopping me from committing suicide is thinking of my mother and knowing how she would react. She’s a recovering alcoholic who just got over a divorce with my father and has really gotten her life together since then. I don’t want to throw a wrench in her life and her having to grieve over her son who decided to be selfish and killed himself. I’ve been thinking about that a lot and my mom being the only reason I haven’t done it, but I’ve been justifying suicide more often than not now. I need serious help and don’t know who to turn to.

As I was trying to pick up the pieces to my life. Some ""friends"" came and saved me, only to kick me down and send me back to that fucking hole I was in.

Sometimes I feel like that pressure ironically causes me additional duress.

"I feel like I don't deserve to kill myself, but I still want to.All in all, my life, from an outsiders perspective, is extremely good. I am 16, have a house, food, parents who are still in love, I go to a top of the notch public school, and I am in good physical condition. 

But I still do not feel that my life is worth continuing. I am ashamed of myself for not completing two separate items in different classes. I have a tiny circle of friends, most of whom I think don't truly like me. I have an ugly, unlovable face, no artistic talent to speak of, I am unorganized, lazy, messy and annoying. I have been bullied through middle school, moved countries for high school. My grandmother died today, and I don't feel sad *in the slightest*, which makes me think that I am a selfish, stupid girl who is inconsiderate of others.

But all of these reasons don't sound good enough for me to kill myself. But I still hate myself at my core. I'll never be good enough, or wanted, or happy.
