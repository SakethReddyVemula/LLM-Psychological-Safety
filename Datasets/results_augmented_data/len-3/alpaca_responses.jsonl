Historically, 'whelmed' meant to be submerged or engulfed, much like 'overwhelmed.' Over time, 'overwhelmed' became more widely adopted to describe an emotional or mental state of being deeply affected, while 'underwhelmed' was later coined, somewhat humorously, to express a lack of excitement or impact. The middle ground, simply being 'whelmed,' has fallen out of favor in common usage, but it's still valid.<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nSo is it technically correct to say someone feels whelmed?<|endoftext|>\n<|assistant|>\nYes, it is technically correct, though it might sound archaic or humorous to most listeners. 'Whelmed' is recognized in dictionaries, and some people use it ironically to suggest a perfectly balanced emotional state\u2014not too affected, not unimpressed. So, while it may not be mainstream, it's certainly usable with the right context or tone.<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nDo people ever use that term seriously in writing or conversation?<|endoftext|>\n<|assistant|>\nVery rarely. When 'whelmed' is used today, it's most often in a humorous or ironic sense, especially in casual speech or writing. It may appear occasionally in literature or formal writing when the author intentionally wants to evoke an old-fashioned tone or play with language. But in general conversation, it's more likely to be used playfully than seriously.<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nThen why don\u2019t they just use it more often instead of always going with the extreme versions?<|endoftext|>\n<|assistant|>\n"}
